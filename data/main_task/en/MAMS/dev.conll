After O
a O
couple O
of O
drinks U-NEU
, O
the O
apps O
-- O
I O
like O
the O
lobster O
/ O
mango O
summer O
roll U-POS
and O
the O
cripsy B-POS
squid L-POS
-- O
go O
down O
great O
. O

The O
basil B-NEG
pepper I-NEG
mojito L-NEG
was O
a O
little O
daunting O
in O
concept O
, O
but O
I O
was O
refreshed O
at O
the O
flavor U-POS
. O

Had O
to O
constantly O
ask O
the O
waiter U-NEG
to O
top O
up O
water B-NEU
glasses L-NEU
, O
but O
generally O
service U-POS
was O
ok O
. O

The O
portions U-NEG
were O
so O
small O
that O
we O
still O
wanted O
to O
eat O
after O
dinner U-NEU
. O

The O
staff U-POS
is O
very O
kind O
and O
well O
trained O
, O
they O
're O
fast O
, O
they O
are O
always O
prompt O
to O
jump O
behind O
the O
bar U-NEU
and O
fix O
drinks U-NEU
, O
they O
know O
details O
of O
every O
item O
in O
the O
menu U-NEU
and O
make O
excelent O
recomendations O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
soup U-POS
was O
so O
clear O
and O
you O
taste O
no O
salt U-NEU
. O

We O
went O
out O
on O
the O
town O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
we O
were O
going O
to O
mingle O
with O
the O
in O
crowd O
, O
you O
know O
, O
go O
to O
a O
place O
where O
you O
pay O
an O
outrageous O
cover O
charge O
, O
have O
to O
wear O
all O
black O
to O
fit O
in O
, O
and O
pay O
$ O
12 O
for O
a O
watered B-NEU
- I-NEU
down I-NEU
martini L-NEU
, O
and O
if O
you O
're O
lucky O
, O
have O
a O
good O
time U-POS
. O

The O
waiter U-NEG
had O
a O
slight O
attitude U-NEG
and O
brought O
our O
wine U-NEU
aprroximately O
10 O
minutes O
into O
our O
appetizer U-NEU
. O

Appetizers U-NEU
and O
entrees O
were O
merely O
adequate O
, O
but O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
pool O
room O
for O
atmosphere U-POS
. O

However O
for O
the O
price U-NEG
I O
paid O
to O
have O
dinner U-NEU
there O
, O
you O
would O
have O
thought O
I O
ate O
a O
horse O
. O

I O
called O
to O
confirm O
the O
reservations O
on O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
lunch U-NEU
and O
the O
hostess U-POS
had O
the O
reservations O
set O
for O
12:30pm O
which O
I O
quickly O
corrected O
. O

The O
small O
bar U-NEU
is O
always O
packed O
with O
people O
, O
and O
you O
have O
to O
constantly O
contend O
with O
waiters U-NEG
asking O
you O
to O
move O
as O
they O
navigate O
through O
the O
crowd O
to O
make O
it O
to O
their O
tables O
. O

Regardless O
of O
the O
amount O
of O
customers O
, O
the O
wait U-NEG
for O
food U-NEU
is O
insanely O
long O
. O

the O
decor U-NEG
is O
n't O
quite O
like O
Shun O
Lee O
but O
the O
service U-POS
will O
definitely O
make O
up O
for O
any O
shortcoming O
. O

And O
there O
was O
n't O
much O
room O
for O
the O
people O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
to O
stand O
either O
, O
as O
the O
restaurant O
attempted O
to O
squeeze O
as O
many O
tables U-NEU
into O
the O
restaurant O
as O
they O
could O
, O
forcing O
those O
dining U-NEU
to O
have O
to O
shift O
in O
their O
chairs U-NEU
every O
time O
a O
waiter U-NEG
attempted O
to O
get O
by O
. O

In O
Short O
It O
's O
a O
bakery O
, O
takeout O
place U-NEU
and O
cafe O
all O
in O
one O
, O
and O
thanks O
to O
dishes U-POS
prepared O
using O
the O
same O
ingredients U-NEU
stocked O
at O
famed O
gourmet O
food O
emporium O
, O
Zabar O
's O
, O
prices U-POS
and O
quality U-POS
are O
upscale O
. O

But O
it O
's O
the O
ambience U-POS
that O
is O
the O
draw O
for O
me O
--- O
sipping O
red B-NEU
wine L-NEU
and O
sitting O
under O
the O
red O
awning O
on O
a O
warm O
night O
. O

The O
service U-POS
was O
fine O
, O
out O
appitizers O
took O
forever O
to O
come O
out O
, O
and O
then O
they O
dumped O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
food U-NEU
on O
us O
, O
without O
giving O
us O
a O
chance O
to O
enjoy O
our O
appitizers O
. O

The O
servers U-NEG
, O
casual O
in O
their O
striped B-NEU
button I-NEU
- I-NEU
downs L-NEU
, O
anticipate O
and O
fulfill O
needs O
as O
if O
they O
were O
trained O
as O
mind O
readers O
. O

The O
food U-POS
did O
come O
out O
quickly O
and O
was O
good O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
the O
prices O
or O
the O
wait U-NEG
. O

The O
fries U-NEG
were O
absolutly O
inedible O
, O
and O
the O
coldslaw O
tasted O
like O
it O
was O
straight O
out O
of O
a O
bucket O
from O
Sam O
's O
, O
and O
the O
friend O
shrimp U-NEU
had O
too O
much O
curry U-NEG
. O

my O
one O
complaint O
is O
that O
when O
we O
were O
finished O
with O
our O
dinner U-NEU
, O
it O
took O
an O
abnormally O
long O
time O
for O
our O
waitress U-NEG
to O
get O
with O
the O
program O
and O
bring O
us O
our O
check O
. O

But O
wait U-NEU
, O
it O
gets O
even O
better O
, O
the O
mussels U-POS
were O
so O
fishy O
that O
I O
had O
the O
server U-NEG
try O
one O
since O
he O
had O
a O
hard O
time O
believing O
that O
this O
was O
true O
. O

This O
place O
happens O
to O
be O
beatifully O
designed O
, O
the O
atmosphere O
is O
relaxed O
( O
as O
opposed O
to O
the O
noisy O
community B-NEG
dining I-NEG
atmosphere L-NEG
in O
so O
many O
busy O
chinese O
reataurants O
- O
which O
can O
also O
be O
OK O
) O
the O
food U-POS
is O
authentic O
Chinese O
as O
opposed O
to O
what O
they O
think O
Americans O
would O
like O
, O
the O
staff U-POS
is O
friendly O
and O
unhurried O
. O

Please O
have O
the O
SPINACH B-POS
DIP L-POS
, O
CAESAR B-POS
SALAD L-POS
, O
HAWAIIAN O
RIB O
- O
EYE O
and O
the O
BROWNIE O
for O
dessert U-NEU
. O

The O
atmosphere U-POS
is O
warmly O
dim O
and O
inviting O
- O
if O
you O
make O
a O
reservation U-NEU
, O
ask O
for O
a O
corner U-NEU
both O
for O
extra O
coziness O
! O

but O
we O
waiting U-NEG
two O
hours O
to O
get O
it O
( O
we O
had O
reservations U-NEU
but O
it O
was O
late O
so O
we O
wanted O
to O
try O
to O
come O
in O
earlier O
) O
. O

The O
waitress U-NEG
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
was O
very O
nasty O
to O
me O
because O
she O
mistakenly O
took O
an O
order O
for O
thai O
ice O
tea O
from O
me O
when O
I O
asked O
for O
thai B-NEU
lemonade L-NEU
in O
a O
to O
- O
go O
cup O
. O

In O
Short O
The O
bi B-NEU
- I-NEU
level I-NEU
dining I-NEU
room L-NEU
, O
which O
resembles O
a O
bamboo O
- O
thatched O
hut O
, O
is O
a O
brightly O
- O
lit O
, O
wide O
- O
open O
space U-POS
with O
high O
ceilings O
and O
laminated O
depictions O
of O
Indian O
village O
life O
. O

Superfine O
is O
my O
preferred O
destination O
in O
the O
city O
when O
I O
'm O
looking O
for O
a O
casual O
, O
hip O
atmosphere U-POS
, O
extraordinary O
food U-POS
at O
decent O
prices U-POS
and/or O
just O
a O
place O
to O
get O
a O
good O
drink O
, O
chat O
with O
the O
bartender U-NEU
and O
shoot O
some O
( O
free O
) O
pool O
. O

An O
otherwise O
fine O
meal U-POS
was O
trashed O
when O
i O
realized O
that O
the O
dish U-NEU
i O
had O
ordered O
contained O
chicked O
, O
despite O
my O
asking O
for O
no O
chicken O
, O
no O
pork O
twice O
. O

The O
Food U-NEU
The O
key O
element O
to O
a O
proper O
British O
chip O
is O
fat O
, O
and O
the O
flabby O
, O
pale O
yellow O
specimens U-POS
here O
come O
close O
to O
the O
ideal O
. O

The O
dinner O
menu O
looks O
like O
it O
has O
a O
more O
interesting O
selection O
of O
entrees U-POS
, O
but O
if O
they O
are O
even O
the O
fraction O
of O
the O
quality U-POS
of O
the O
items O
we O
ate O
for O
lunch U-NEU
, O
I O
whole O
- O
heartedly O
advise O
you O
to O
make O
it O
a O
point O
and O
dine O
at O
Creama O
-- O
if O
not O
for O
the O
drinks O
, O
then O
definitely O
for O
the O
unique O
approach O
to O
mexican U-NEU
. O

We O
made O
a O
reservation U-NEU
for O
5:30pm O
( O
20 O
people O
) O
and O
people O
were O
still O
arriving O
at O
5:45 O
( O
over O
half O
the O
group O
was O
there O
) O
when O
the O
manager U-NEG
came O
over O
and O
literally O
yelled O
at O
us O
for O
not O
being O
on O
time O
saying O
it O
was O
a O
busy O
time O
for O
him O
, O
when O
in O
fact O
there O
were O
several O
empty O
tables U-NEU
throughout O
the O
restaurant O
. O

When O
I O
went O
for O
sunday O
brunch U-NEU
, O
not O
only O
was O
the O
food U-NEG
bland O
and O
cold O
, O
they O
did O
n't O
even O
bother O
to O
clear O
the O
plates U-NEU
once O
they O
brought O
the O
bill U-NEU
. O

The O
Wasa U-NEU
Waffle O
was O
different O
but O
when O
we O
spoke O
to O
the O
manager U-POS
he O
inmediatly O
changed O
if O
for O
another O
dish U-NEU
( O
He O
suggested O
the O
Chocolate O
decadence O
French O
Toast O
. O

The O
pizza U-POS
is O
thet O
always O
fresh O
and O
just O
made O
they O
hav O
an O
outdoor B-NEU
seating I-NEU
area L-NEU
that O
is O
partially O
covered O
they O
also O
have O
a O
full O
service U-POS
restaurant O
on O
the O
premises O
they O
make O
everything O
on O
premises O
. O

Consistently O
satisfying O
versions O
of O
Thai B-POS
staples L-POS
like O
pad B-NEU
Thai I-NEU
and I-NEU
curry I-NEU
dishes L-NEU
arrive O
in O
generous O
portions U-POS
. O

I O
naively O
thought O
dinner U-NEU
was O
served U-NEU
during O
the O
show O
, O
but O
the O
waiters U-NEG
do O
n't O
come O
by O
once O
the O
shows O
start O
, O
so O
order O
your O
wine U-NEU
30 O
mins O
before O
the O
show O
start O
time O
. O

The O
menu U-NEG
is O
limited O
so O
I O
opted O
for O
the O
jalapeno O
potato O
soup O
and O
a O
romaine B-NEU
salad L-NEU
. O

Other O
guests O
enjoyed O
pizza U-POS
, O
santa B-POS
fe I-POS
chopped I-POS
salad L-POS
and O
fish B-NEU
and I-NEU
chips L-NEU
. O

The O
items O
available O
during O
dimsum U-NEU
time O
were O
plentiful O
- O
the O
turnip B-POS
cake L-POS
was O
excellent O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
going O
at O
off O
- O
times O
( O
before O
7 O
perhaps O
) O
to O
avoid O
the O
crowds U-NEG
as O
it O
gets O
packed O
and O
there O
is O
n't O
much O
room O
by O
the O
bar U-NEU
. O

I O
mean O
no O
disrespect O
to O
the O
owner O
, O
just O
constructive O
criticism O
- O
improve O
the O
decor U-NEG
and O
dine O
- O
in O
service O
, O
but O
DON'T O
change O
the O
portions U-NEU
or O
the O
recipes U-NEU
. O

At O
no O
point O
during O
our O
dinner U-NEU
were O
we O
left O
alone O
to O
simply O
enjoy O
our O
food U-POS
. O

Waitress U-NEG
did O
n't O
know O
anything O
about O
the O
menu U-NEU
, O
but O
other O
than O
that O
I O
would O
recommend O
. O

With O
tacky O
kitsch O
as O
the O
decor U-NEG
's O
dominant O
motif O
and O
the O
obligatory U-NEG
grousing O
waiters U-NEG
hustling O
out O
brick O
- O
sized O
steaks O
and O
icy O
vodka U-NEU
to O
gussied O
- O
up O
regulars O
and O
tourists O
, O
an O
evening O
at O
Sammy O
's O
is O
both O
dinner U-NEU
and O
street O
theater O
. O

Handsome O
baritone O
Nordic O
waiters U-POS
patrol O
the O
room O
, O
proffering O
fresh O
- O
squeezed O
juices O
and O
$ O
4-a O
- O
person O
pots O
of O
French O
press B-NEU
coffee L-NEU
. O

Although O
it O
was O
quite O
good O
, O
the O
small O
portions U-NEG
at O
this O
table O
of O
4 O
, O
including O
appetizers U-NEU
, O
did O
not O
constitute O
adequate O
sustenance O
. O

The O
green B-NEG
hair I-NEG
table L-NEG
and O
seating U-NEG
at O
the O
front B-NEU
window L-NEU
was O
tacky O
and O
gimmicky O
, O
but O
figured O
it O
's O
the O
food U-POS
that O
counts O
. O

The O
food O
was O
average O
: O
the O
almond B-NEG
crusted I-NEG
halibut L-NEG
was O
bland O
, O
while O
the O
sashimi B-POS
appetizer L-POS
was O
excellent O
. O

First O
, O
the O
hostess U-NEG
gave O
us O
a O
nasty O
look O
when O
asked O
if O
we O
could O
eat O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
, O
and O
then O
just O
swished O
her O
hand O
to O
indicate O
we O
could O
seat O
ourselves O
. O

Despite O
him O
not O
being O
my O
designated O
server U-POS
, O
he O
basically O
took O
over O
for O
our O
inexperienced O
waiter U-NEG
the O
rest O
of O
the O
dinner U-NEU
. O

After O
requesting O
to O
be O
seated O
at O
an O
empty O
table O
, O
the O
waitress U-NEG
( O
who O
was O
so O
terribly O
burdened O
when O
we O
asked O
to O
move O
from O
the O
bar U-NEU
to O
the O
table O
to O
have O
dinner U-NEU
) O
asked O
us O
to O
get O
up O
from O
our O
seats O
and O
wait O
for O
a O
smaller O
table O
because O
a O
party O
of O
3 O
just O
walked O
in O
. O

Sat O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
and O
orderd O
a O
few O
appetizers O
, O
the O
humus B-POS
and I-POS
cheese I-POS
plates L-POS
along O
with O
some O
calamari U-POS
- O
all O
very O
tasty O
. O

the O
hostess O
is O
rude O
as O
can O
be O
, O
the O
waiters O
ca O
n't O
stop O
to O
check O
in O
, O
the O
busboys U-NEG
are O
flinging O
stuff O
on O
your O
table U-NEU
, O
and O
that O
's O
true O
even O
when O
the O
restaurant O
is O
half O
empty O
! O

Call O
it O
a O
bar U-NEU
with O
weak O
but O
tasty O
sangria U-POS
and O
leave O
it O
at O
that O
. O

For O
$ O
65 O
, O
you O
will O
get O
a O
5 O

course O

etc O
. O

Never O
on O
the O
menu U-NEU
or O
in O
my O
inquiry O
to O
the O
waitress U-NEG
was O
the O
word O
garlic O
mentioned O
. O

i O
was O
at O
opia O
january O
5 O
, O
2006 O
we O
had O
some O
drinks U-NEU
, O
dinner U-NEU
, O
i O
have O
to O
say O
that O
we O
had O
me O
and O
my O
friend O
great O
time O
, O
the O
staff U-POS
was O
listening O
, O
the O
manager U-POS
knew O
what O
he O
was O
doing O
and O
the O
food O
better O
than O
ever O
! O
! O

It O
was O
n't O
until O
we O
spoke O
with O
management U-NEG
that O
we O
were O
able O
to O
finish O
our O
meal U-NEU
and O
get O
out O
of O
the O
restaurant O
, O
but O
already O
one O
of O
our O
party O
had O
to O
leave O
early O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
were O
late O
for O
our O
afternoon O
engagements U-NEU
. O

It O
is O
a O
must O
for O
lunch U-NEU
, O
dinner U-NEU
or O
anytime O
you O
have O
a O
big O
appetite O
and O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
spend O
big O
bucks O
in O
the O
big O
Apple U-POS
! O

What O
it O
lacks O
in O
decor U-NEG
it O
more O
than O
makes O
up O
in O
the O
cuisine U-POS
. O

Went O
for O
lunch U-NEU
the O
bartenders U-POS
were O
great O
, O
also O
they O
had O
a O
DJ U-NEU
playing O
music O
during O
the O
day O
, O
there O
was O
a O
Huge O
screen O
tv O
playing O
music O
videos O
and O
a O
bunch O
of O
other O
tvs O
with O
all O
the O
sports O
you O
could O
look O
at O
. O

The O
waitress U-POS
encouraged O
to O
come O
for O
dinner U-NEU
and O
brunch U-NEU
, O
and O
I O
followed O
her O
recommandation O
. O

Our O
waiter U-POS
was O
very O
prompt O
and O
friendly O
, O
but O
the O
worst O
part O
of O
the O
experience O
was O
actually O
after O
the O
meal U-NEU
when O
I O
was O
leaving O
. O

Me O
and O
my O
wife O
we O
go O
there O
at O
least O
once O
a O
month O
, O
the O
food U-POS
they O
give O
you O
is O
amazing O
we O
only O
get O
one O
order O
of O
pasta U-NEU
and O
main B-NEU
course L-NEU
it O
is O
enough O
for O
both O
to O
share O
, O
we O
get O
full O
and O
satisfied O
, O
our O
favorite O
dish U-POS
penne O
with O
pesto U-POS
. O

The O
service U-POS
has O
always O
been O
outstanding O
and O
even O
when O
we O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
reservation U-NEU
they O
worked O
something O
out O
, O
where O
I O
agreed O
to O
keep O
our O
meal U-NEU
to O
just O
eating O
. O

the O
hostess O
was O
n't O
sure O
until O
3 O
hours O
later O
10:28 O
: O
Here O
we O
go O
Eggplant O
parmigiana O
fried O
grease O
an O
heavy O
duty O
Pollo O
dish U-NEG
covered O
with O
1/4 O
of O
a O
pound O
of O
mozzarella U-NEU
. O

Once O
we O
ordered O
, O
it O
took O
at O
least O
30 O
minutes O
to O
get O
our O
food U-NEU
, O
with O
our O
server U-NEG
no O
where O
in O
site O
. O

Thanks O
to O
waiter U-POS
I O
learned O
so O
much O
about O
wine U-NEU
too O
. O

Down O
right O
comfortable O
, O
pleasant O
, O
enormous O
portions U-POS
, O
have O
lunch U-NEU
and O
bring O
home O
a O
doggie O
bag O
wth O
your O
dinner U-NEU
. O

A O
couple O
of O
hints O
: O
1 O
) O
avoid O
going O
during O
peak O
lunch U-NEU
and O
dinner U-NEU
hours O
- O
everything O
is O
made O
fresh O
so O
it O
takes O
time O
, O
2 O
) O
definitely O
try O
their O
Concrete O
desert O
- O
my O
favorite O
is O
chocolate U-POS
with O
bananas U-POS
and O
hot O
fudge O
mixed O
in O
. O

We O
felt O
the O
waiter U-NEG
and O
captain U-NEG
rushed O
us O
through O
our O
meal U-NEU
. O

The O
desserts U-POS
are O
just O
as O
good O
as O
all O
the O
coffee U-NEU
shops O
around O
town O
but O
they O
charge O
more O
than O
anyone O
. O

You O
might O
be O
lucky O
enough O
to O
hear O
your O
waiter U-NEG
say O
, O
May O
I O
take O
zee O
order O
from O
you O
, O
Pig B-NEU
Dog L-NEU
, O
while O
you O
're O
there O
. O

Recommended O
to O
those O
who O
want O
to O
try O
a O
different O
setting U-POS
for O
a O
diner U-NEU
. O

Definitely O
one O
of O
the O
Slope O
's O
best O
bets O
for O
Chinese B-POS
food L-POS
-- O
or O
for O
vegetarians O
( O
there O
's O
an O
extensive O
veggy O
menu U-POS
, O
as O
well O
as O
many O
meat B-NEU
dishes L-NEU
) O
. O

In O
the O
main B-NEU
dining I-NEU
room L-NEU
, O
finding O
your O
waiter U-NEG
is O
Hell O
and O
aside O
from O
when O
they O
take O
your O
order O
and O
bring O
the O
bill O
, O
you O
'll O
rarely O
see O
them O
. O

We O
had O
a O
five B-NEU
- I-NEU
course I-NEU
dinner L-NEU
and O
none O
of O
the O
dishes U-NEG
really O
impressed O
except O
maybe O
the O
signature B-POS
oysters L-POS
and O
pearls O
. O

The O
food U-POS
is O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
the O
staff U-POS
would O
rather O
be O
anywhere O
than O
waiting B-NEU
tables L-NEU
at O
Maison O
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch U-NEU
on O
a O
quiet O
weekday U-POS
afternoon O
and O
everything O
my O
friend O
and O
I O
ordered O
was O
immaculately O
presented O
and O
absolutely O
delicious-- O
I O
had O
moules B-POS
frites L-POS
and O
she O
had O
the O
salmon B-POS
burger L-POS
. O

the O
food U-NEG
is O
not O
nearly O
good O
enough O
to O
wait O
an O
hour O
before O
seeing O
your O
server U-NEG
, O
or O
wait O
another O
hour O
for O
the O
wrong O
entrees U-NEG
, O
or O
for O
the O
manager U-POS
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
by O
charging O
for O
everthing O
but O
giving O
us O
on O
the O
house O
shot O
glasses O
of O
watery O
margaritas O
. O

And O
although O
I O
've O
noticed O
that O
the O
prices U-NEG
have O
gone O
up O
a O
little O
since O
they O
opened O
, O
it O
's O
still O
a O
great O
menu U-POS
. O

For O
dinner U-NEU
I O
recommend O
Carne O
Tampiquea O
( O
steak O
) O
And O
for O
brunch U-NEU
the O
Huaraches O
with O
meat O
and O
a O
couple O
eggs U-POS
on O
top O
, O
a O
typical O
mexican O
hangover O
plate O
! O

Even O
with O
reservation U-NEU
, O
it O
might O
take O
up O
to O
one O
hour O
to O
get O
a O
table O
and O
the O
staff U-NEG
might O
not O
even O
say O
a O
word O
about O
it O
. O

The O
food O
is O
above O
average O
, O
though O
the O
portions U-NEG
a O
tad O
small O
, O
even O
for O
tapas O
; O
but O
they O
more O
than O
make O
up O
for O
it O
with O
their O
wonderfull O
mojitos U-POS
. O

as O
for O
the O
people O
whom O
posted O
about O
the O
salad U-NEU
, O
I O
never O
had O
it O
, O
as O
for O
the O
person O
that O
had O
no O
sides O
with O
the O
steak U-NEU
, O
they O
must O
have O
made O
a O
mistake O
, O
everytime O
I O
go O
its O
come O
's O
with O
awesome O
potatoes U-POS
. O

The O
service U-NEG
was O
adequate O
though O
we O
did O
need O
to O
keep O
asking O
for O
water O
and O
the O
drinks U-NEU
from O
the O
bar U-NEU
took O
a O
long O
time- O
plus O
the O
restaraurant O
was O
not O
crowded O
. O

The O
arrogant O
maitre'd O
was O
annoyed O
when O
i O
asked O
about O
sitting O
down O
those O
tables O
are O
for O
other O
reservations U-NEU
low O
and O
behold O
those O
tables O
were O
still O
open O
as O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
finished O
dinner U-NEU
. O

I O
have O
been O
here O
a O
few O
times O
and O
never O
had O
a O
boring O
meal!Food O
always O
fresh O
, O
service U-POS
very O
civilized O
. O

Over O
a O
period O
of O
time O
some O
restaurants O
tend O
to O
loose O
the O
quality U-NEG
of O
the O
taste U-NEG
of O
their O
food U-NEU
, O
but O
not O
Ray O
's O
. O

The O
manager U-POS
very O
politely O
told O
the O
drunk O
man O
that O
he O
could O
leave O
and O
then O
gave O
everyone O
on O
the O
resturaunt O
a O
free O
glass U-NEU
of O
port O
for O
having O
to O
witness O
it O
. O

Save O
the O
$ O
$ O
and O
go O
to O
to O
curry O
hill O
( O
just O
2 O
- O
3 O
blocks O
away O
) O
or O
spend O
the O
$ O
$ O
at O
a O
midtown O
indian O
eatery O
( O
Also O
: O
I O
commented O
to O
hostess U-NEU
prior O
to O
seating U-NEU
that O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
tables U-NEG
empty O
when O
choosing O
my O
seat O
, O
and O
she O
snapped O
back O
that O
they O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
reservations U-NEU
coming O
in O
at O
one O
time O
. O

An O
unfriendly O
hostess U-NEG
greeted O
us O
and O
placed O
us O
in O
the O
main O
room O
of O
the O
restaurant O
where O
the O
tables U-NEG
were O
so O
close O
together O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
guests O
and O
waiter U-NEU
to O
move O
without O
bumping O
you O
. O

All O
in O
all O
the O
food U-POS
was O
above O
average O
and O
I O
would O
return O
to O
see O
how O
they O
operate O
with O
four O
or O
less O
dinners U-NEU
. O

It O
took O
forever O
to O
seat U-NEG
us O
even O
though O
the O
restaurant O
was O
almost O
completely O
empty O
, O
then O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
to O
be O
waited O
on O
, O
it O
took O
another O
15 O
minutes O
to O
get O
our O
drinks U-NEU
, O
and O
then O
another O
30 O
minutes O
to O
get O
our O
salad O
and O
then O
even O
more O
time O
to O
get O
our O
pizza O
and O
then O
our O
bill O
. O

The O
Scene U-NEU
At O
this O
sleek O
spot O
on O
a O
relatively O
sparse O
stretch O
of O
Spring O
Street O
, O
regulars O
belly O
up O
to O
a O
small O
bar U-NEG
and O
greet O
owner U-POS
Giorgio O
DeLuca O
, O
of O
Dean O
and O
DeLuca O
fame O
, O
with O
warm O
hugs U-POS
. O

The O
food U-NEG
seems O
so O
- O
so O
, O
although O
the O
nachos O
were O
really O
yummy O
( O
fake O
hot O
cheese O
w/ O
big O
cups O
of O
beans U-POS
, O
chili B-POS
guac L-POS
on O
the O
side O
) O
. O

both O
appetizer O
and O
main U-NEG
were O
poorly O
made O
by O
some O
random O
cooks U-NEU
the O
picked O
up O
from O
who O
knows O
where O
. O

But O
a O
server U-NEG
coming O
up O
to O
the O
table O
chewing O
gum O
while O
she O
went O
through O
the O
specials U-NEU
is O
not O
my O
idea O
of O
professional O
. O

Called O
to O
complain O
and O
the O
response U-POS
was O
well O
, O
we O
did O
n't O
charge O
you O
for O
the O
falafel B-NEU
sandwich L-NEU
we O
shorted O
you O
. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
by O
the O
door U-NEU
, O
and O
the O
host U-NEG
failed O
to O
acknowledge O
our O
existence O
for O
a O
whole O
15 O
minutes O
! O

They O
kept O
us O
waiting U-NEG
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
WITH O
a O
reservation U-NEU
and O
WITHOUT O
an O
apology O
. O

The O
food U-POS
is O
incredibly O
tasting O
and O
, O
if O
you O
want O
an O
advice O
: O
Grill B-NEU
calamari L-NEU
, O
Rigatoni U-NEU
a O
la O
vodka O
and O
, O
for O
dessert U-NEU
, O
Tartufata O
. O

The O
' O
people O
watching O
' O
and O
table B-NEU
location L-NEU
( O
on O
boardwalk O
) O
made O
up O
for O
the O
rude O
service U-NEG
. O

I O
liked O
the O
hummos B-POS
platter L-POS
, O
the O
brie B-POS
sandwich L-POS
, O
and O
about O
20 O
other O
things O
on O
the O
menu U-NEU
( O
if O
they O
still O
have O
the O
chocolate B-POS
cake L-POS
you O
need O
to O
get O
it O
) O
. O

Only O
drawback O
is O
the O
sound O
level O
- O
quite O
a O
loud O
space B-NEG
downstairs L-NEG
- O
and O
that O
might O
be O
accounted O
for O
with O
their O
trendy O
bar U-POS
and O
right O
off O
Times O
Square O
. O

We O
are O
a O
huge O
fan O
of O
their O
brunch U-POS
- O
specifically O
the O
blt O
with O
a O
fried B-NEU
egg I-NEU
and I-NEU
avocado L-NEU
and O
their O
asparagus B-NEU
omelette I-NEU
with I-NEU
truffle I-NEU
oil L-NEU
. O

For O
dinner U-NEU
we O
decided O
to O
share O
on O
the O
Veal B-POS
Cordon I-POS
Blue L-POS
( O
wow O
) O
and O
the O
Artic O
char O
, O
a O
nice O
dish U-POS
. O

Sashimi U-NEU
was O
ok O
( O
maki O
rolls U-POS
tasted O
better O
) O
. O

Worth O
the O
trip O
over O
the O
bridge O
, O
worth O
the O
search O
for O
parking O
, O
worth O
the O
wait O
for O
a O
table U-POS
at O
dinner U-NEU
time O
and O
worthy O
of O
a O
ten O
rating O
. O

We O
were O
told O
by O
the O
hostess U-NEG
to O
make O
sure O
we O
were O
on O
time O
for O
our O
reservation U-NEU
, O
which O
we O
were O
, O
but O
then O
they O
kept O
us O
waiting U-NEG
for O
15 O
minutes O
when O
we O
got O
there O
. O

While O
the O
deocr O
in O
the O
dining B-NEG
room L-NEG
is O
less O
than O
inviting O
, O
I O
recommend O
eating O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
where O
there O
is O
full O
menu O
service O
. O

Relaxed O
neighborhooders O
treat O
the O
spot U-POS
like O
a O
second O
home O
, O
calling O
the O
staff U-POS
by O
name O
and O
lingering O
despite O
the O
smallish O
bar U-NEU
and O
hurried O
courses O
. O

The O
Scene U-NEU
Schnack O
feels O
a O
lot O
like O
a O
roller O
- O
rink O
concession O
stand O
circa O
1982 O
, O
from O
the O
deep O
vinyl O
booths O
and O
beat O
- O
up O
chairs O
right O
down O
to O
the O
loud O
music O
and O
plastic O
menu B-NEG
boards L-NEG
. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
attractively O
decorated O
but O
totally O
lacks O
an O
atmosphere U-NEG
partly O
because O
of O
the O
extra O
bright O
lighting U-POS
. O

Same O
quality O
for O
1/3 O
the O
price U-NEU
and O
a O
realistic O
atmosphere U-POS
. O

Also O
available O
is O
eggplant B-POS
in I-POS
garlic I-POS
sauce L-POS
, O
the O
Zen B-NEU
vegi I-NEU
- I-NEU
burger L-NEU
, O
with O
sunflower O
seeds O
, O
kale O
and O
brown O
rice O
, O
and O
curry O
- O
rice O
- O
noodle O
soup U-POS
. O

Then O
, O
the O
waitress U-NEG
gave O
my O
wife O
coffee O
with O
regular O
milk O
in O
it O
even O
though O
my O
wife O
specifically O
requested O
Soy B-NEU
Milk L-NEU
. O

I O
will O
definitely O
try O
dinner U-POS
, O
but O
they O
do O
need O
to O
fix O
the O
kitchen U-NEU
shifts O
so O
that O
people O
get O
served O
in O
a O
reasonable O
time O
. O

One O
of O
the O
managers U-NEU
offered O
us O
a O
seat U-NEU
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
to O
wait U-NEU
for O
a O
table O
, O
there O
we O
had O
the O
most O
amazing O
empanadas U-POS
and O
red O
sangria U-POS
. O

You O
fry O
it O
in O
your O
batter U-NEU
and O
roll O
it O
up O
in O
spices U-NEU
, O
big O
chunky B-POS
blue I-POS
cheese L-POS
makes O
them O
taste O
so O
nice O
's O
. O

We O
are O
laidback O
diners U-NEU
and O
as O
we O
've O
both O
waited O
tables U-NEU
, O
we O
tend O
to O
be O
forgiving O
of O
irregular O
service U-NEG
. O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
the O
food U-NEU
is O
like O
here O
, O
I O
only O
come O
for O
the O
frozen B-POS
margaritas L-POS
which O
I O
find O
to O
be O
the O
best O
I O
've O
found O
in O
the O
city O
and O
the O
grilled B-NEU
corn L-NEU
. O

it O
took O
forever O
for O
the O
waiter U-NEG
to O
take O
my O
order O
as O
he O
was O
too O
busy O
chatting O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
. O

The O
waitress U-NEG
apologized O
for O
the O
long O
wait O
and O
said O
they O
would O
give O
us O
some O
free O
drinks U-POS
or O
desert O
since O
they O
forgot O
about O
our O
orders O
but O
we O
never O
received O
anything O
and O
by O
the O
time O
we O
got O
the O
bill O
we O
just O
wanted O
to O
pay O
and O
leave O
. O

The O
price U-POS
is O
well O
worth O
the O
quality U-POS
and O
quantity U-POS
of O
food U-NEU
. O

My O
friend O
and O
I O
walked O
in O
to O
an O
over O
crowded O
bar U-NEG
and O
were O
warned O
of O
a O
45 O
minute O
wait U-NEU
. O

Count O
on O
fresh O
, O
fairly O
priced O
cuts O
of O
fish U-POS
that O
represent O
a O
good O
value O
, O
even O
if O
portions U-NEG
are O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
small O
side O
. O

Even O
with O
our O
reservation U-NEU
, O
they O
had O
us O
waiting U-NEG
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
for O
over O
an O
hour O
. O

Most O
diners O
stick O
to O
hot O
( O
shredded B-NEU
chicken I-NEU
breast I-NEU
in I-NEU
garlic L-NEU
and O
walnut O
sauce O
) O
and O
cold O
( O
briny O
tapenade O
, O
made O
with O
Greek B-NEU
olives L-NEU
, O
capers O
and O
anchovies O
) O
meze O
, O
served O
in O
handsome O
vintage O
dishes U-POS
. O

Seated O
just O
after O
2 O
; O
I O
commend O
them O
'cause O
they O
were O
the O
only O
decent O
brunch B-POS
spot L-POS
that O
would O
take O
our O
reservation U-NEU
, O
and O
they O
did O
their O
best O
to O
seat O
us O
promptly O
. O

After O
the O
grilled O
calamari O
, O
we O
got O
onion B-NEG
soup L-NEG
that O
had O
no O
soup O
, O
a O
dish O
of O
beans U-NEU
that O
had O
no O
flavor U-NEG
, O
the O
kitchen O
did O
n't O
make O
one O
of O
the O
three O
pasta O
dishes O
ordered O
, O
and O
the O
pork B-NEG
chop L-NEG
and O
other O
main O
dishes O
were O
not O
very O
good O
. O

The O
servers O
were O
prompt O
and O
attentive O
, O
but O
the O
food U-NEG
arrived O
lukewarm O
( O
maybe O
it O
was O
served U-POS
so O
quickly O
because O
it O
was O
pre O
- O
cooked O
and O
had O
been O
sitting O
out O
for O
a O
while O
) O
and O
was O
not O
all O
that O
flavorful O
. O

Like O
the O
other O
Bromberg O
Brothers O
establishments O
, O
expect O
the O
customer U-NEU
is O
always O
wrong O
attitude O
from O
the O
staff U-NEG
along O
with O
overpriced O
wines U-NEG
you O
never O
heard O
of O
, O
no O
bar U-NEG
, O
tiny O
waiting B-NEG
area L-NEG
and O
lousy O
desserts U-NEG
. O

My O
friend O
also O
knew O
the O
chef O
, O
so O
we O
had O
some O
other O
courses O
not O
on O
the O
menu U-NEU
, O
but O
even O
knowing O
the O
chef O
did O
n't O
get O
us O
the O
service U-NEG
I O
would O
expect O
at O
this O
type O
of O
restaurant O
. O

First O
, O
the O
seating B-NEG
people L-NEG
gave O
me O
huge O
attitude O
and O
claimed O
I O
had O
not O
reserved O
a O
table O
at O
the O
grotto O
- O
and O
I O
quote O
my O
reservation U-NEU
You O
are O
all O
set O
for O
the O
grotta O
this O
saturday O
. O

Getting O
into O
the O
steak B-NEU
frites L-NEU
takes O
some O
sawing O
, O
but O
once O
cut O
, O
the O
meat U-POS
is O
flavorful O
, O
if O
in O
need O
of O
salt O
. O

I O
liked O
the O
place U-POS
and O
the O
people U-POS
, O
but O
we O
really O
went O
to O
have O
dinner O
no O
appetizers U-NEG
as O
the O
whole O
dinner O
. O

and O
if O
that O
was O
n't O
enough O
the O
owner U-NEG
threw O
in O
a O
free O
beer U-NEU
each O
for O
me O
and O
my O
friend O
. O

Other O
small O
dishes U-NEG
, O
such O
as O
the O
fragrant B-POS
sesame I-POS
oil I-POS
- I-POS
scented I-POS
raw I-POS
spicy I-POS
tuna L-POS
, O
are O
excellent O
with O
a O
beer O
- O
sized O
mug O
of O
cold O
oolong O
tea U-POS
. O

True O
, O
the O
ambiance U-NEG
is O
something O
out O
of O
Goodfellas O
, O
but O
it O
the O
food U-POS
and O
waiters U-POS
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
! O

I O
was O
impressed O
with O
every O
dish U-POS
and O
was O
tempted O
to O
go O
back O
for O
dinner U-NEU
that O
night O
! O

junk O
food B-NEU
place L-NEU
that O
could O
do O
well O
with O
a O
good O
cleaning U-POS
. O

There O
's O
even O
a O
nice O
menu O
of O
savory B-POS
items I-POS
served L-POS
during O
late O
lunch O
and O
dinner B-NEU
hours L-NEU
. O

The O
numbness O
in O
your O
lower O
legs O
from O
sitting O
on O
old O
wood B-NEG
chairs L-NEG
is O
more O
than O
compensated O
by O
the O
wonderful O
food U-POS
. O

They O
kept O
the O
chef O
, O
margarita O
machines O
, O
and O
practically O
the O
identical O
menu U-POS
from O
Miracle O
Grill U-NEU
( O
the O
restaurant O
that O
formerly O
had O
the O
space U-NEU
) O
; O
how O
is O
it O
that O
everything O
here O
is O
so O
much O
worse O
? O

I O
like O
to O
drink U-POS
a O
variety O
of O
teas O
, O
but O
I O
've O
had O
some O
here O
that O
are O
really O
weird O
that O
I O
would O
avoid O
next O
time U-NEU
. O

The O
organic B-NEU
free I-NEU
range I-NEU
chicken L-NEU
was O
a O
6 O
, O
the O
lamb B-POS
chop L-POS
was O
excellent O
, O
and O
we O
had O
to O
send O
the O
halibut O
back O
2x O
with O
no O
result- O
ended O
up O
having O
to O
order O
anther O
dish U-NEU
( O
cod O
) O
in O
which O
the O
fish U-POS
was O
good O
but O
the O
clams O
were O
too O
tough O
to O
eat O
and O
the O
sausage U-NEG
was O
n't O
even O
finished O
cooking O
( O
thus O
could O
not O
be O
consumed O
) O
. O

The O
drinks U-NEG
are O
very O
pricey O
and O
small O
, O
and O
the O
food O
is O
ok O
- O
but O
the O
portion B-POS
size L-POS
for O
the O
price O
is O
outrageous O
. O

My O
date O
and O
I O
were O
both O
taken O
back O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
the O
friendly O
attitude U-POS
from O
the O
owner U-NEU
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

First O
, O
the O
waiter U-NEG
brought O
us O
to O
a O
table O
where O
people O
were O
still O
finishing O
their O
coffee O
from O
their O
meal U-NEU
- O
he O
told O
them O
the O
restaurant O
was O
busy O
and O
they O
needed O
to O
finish O
now O
and O
to O
pay O
their O
bill O
inside O
. O

Our O
lovely O
waiter U-POS
sent O
us O
off O
with O
scones O
for O
breakfast U-NEU
the O
following O
AM O
! O

For O
entree U-NEU
I O
would O
recommand O
the O
rabbit B-POS
curry L-POS
- O
the O
meat U-POS
was O
cooked O
very O
finely O
and O
the O
curry B-POS
sauce L-POS
, O
though O
a O
bit O
too O
sweet O
, O
went O
well O
with O
rice O
. O

After O
a O
crazy O
day O
@ O
work O
, O
with O
no O
reservation U-NEU
, O
we O
were O
so O
lucky O
to O
score O
a O
seat U-NEU
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
on O
an O
incredibly O
busy O
evening U-NEG
. O

Besides O
, O
vegetarian O
or O
not O
, O
there O
are O
always O
ways O
to O
liven O
up O
food U-NEG
without O
compromising O
the O
healthy O
aspect U-POS
. O

I O
read O
about O
this O
place O
in O
the O
Post O
, O
but O
never O
stepped O
foot O
in O
it O
I O
ordered O
a O
red B-NEU
velvet I-NEU
cake L-NEU
to O
be O
delivered O
to O
lOwer O
Manhattan O
; O
It O
got O
there O
, O
and O
the O
broads U-POS
at O
the O
office O
raved O
about O
it O
! O

If O
you O
are O
undecided O
about O
which O
sandwich O
to O
choose O
, O
go O
for O
the O
Indecision U-NEU
, O
which O
is O
a O
trio O
of O
smaller O
sandwiches U-NEG
on O
the O
menu U-NEU
. O

If O
you O
had O
good O
service U-POS
there O
, O
try O
to O
get O
your O
waiter U-NEU
's O
name O
and O
request O
him O
/ O
her O
by O
name O
the O
next O
time O
. O

I O
prefer O
to O
sit O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
as O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
listen O
to O
loud O
, O
boring O
conversations O
from O
the O
next B-NEU
table L-NEU
who O
always O
seem O
to O
be O
friends O
of O
the O
owner U-NEG
. O

The O
waiter U-NEG
spent O
a O
long O
time O
telling O
us O
about O
the O
menu U-NEU
( O
and O
more O
about O
his O
own O
life O
history O
in O
the O
process O
. O

We O
had O
a O
nice O
bottle B-POS
of I-POS
wine L-POS
, O
dinner U-NEU
, O
and O
dessert U-POS
for O
under O
$ O
200 O
. O

Everything O
on O
the O
menu U-NEU
is O
satisfyingly O
savory O
, O
from O
a O
simple O
pot U-POS
of O
mussels U-POS
in O
a O
choice O
of O
sauces O
( O
beer O
- O
and O
- O
bacon O
, O
creamy O
mushroom O
, O
or O
white B-NEU
- I-NEU
wine I-NEU
- I-NEU
and I-NEU
- I-NEU
garlic I-NEU
broth L-NEU
) O
, O
to O
beef B-NEU
stewed L-NEU
with O
beer O
and O
prunes O
, O
to O
a O
juicy O
croque O
- O
monsieur O
, O
and O
beyond O
. O

The O
wait B-POS
staff L-POS
did O
n't O
bother O
to O
refill O
my O
water U-NEU
until O
I O
had O
finish O
mine O
and O
was O
almost O
done O
with O
my O
husband O
's O
glass O
too O
. O

Yes O
, O
this O
place U-POS
is O
good O
, O
a O
cut O
above O
some O
of O
the O
other O
local O
diner B-NEU
food L-NEU
and O
a O
nice O
, O
friendly O
atmosphere U-POS
. O

since O
we O
're O
informed O
its O
service U-NEG
isslow O
we O
had O
dinner U-NEU
in O
midtownwent O
for O
dessertb O
- O
day O
thing O
. O

It O
's O
one O
of O
our O
take B-NEU
- I-NEU
out I-NEU
staples L-NEU
because O
of O
the O
good O
food U-POS
, O
fast O
delivery U-POS
time O
and O
the O
cheap O
price U-POS
( O
for O
under O
$ O
25 O
we O
have O
a O
dinner U-NEU
for O
2 O
and O
with O
left O
- O
overs O
) O
. O

Too O
late O
to O
get O
a O
reservation U-NEU
so O
we O
went O
upstairs O
where O
initially O
the O
crowded O
scene U-NEG
threw O
me O
for O
a O
loop O
. O

The O
Scene U-NEU
Chief O
among O
the O
neighborhood O
's O
bustling O
cafes O
is O
Kolonaki O
, O
with O
its O
inviting O
upstairs B-POS
space L-POS
, O
replete O
with O
rich O
, O
dark O
wood B-POS
tables L-POS
and O
windowsills O
. O

The O
texture U-NEG
of O
their O
flat B-NEU
noodles L-NEU
is O
something O
that O
has O
to O
be O
experienced O
to O
understand O
. O

Although O
, O
we O
were O
seated O
within O
an O
hour O
, O
the O
bartender O
and O
waiter O
were O
very O
nice O
and O
the O
food U-POS
was O
good O
( O
although O
my O
pork U-NEG
was O
too O
salty O
) O
we O
would O
not O
return O
. O

The O
only O
blemish O
was O
our O
waitress U-NEG
, O
who O
left O
us O
with O
empty O
drinks U-NEU
for O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
. O

We O
( O
naturally O
) O
asked O
for O
a O
discount U-NEU
when O
the O
bill O
came O
, O
and O
our O
waitress U-NEG
disappeared O
for O
a O
moment O
and O
offered O
us O
. O

When O
the O
bill O
finally O
arrived O
, O
the O
head O
waiter U-NEG
sternly O
told O
us O
that O
this O
time O
is O
okay O
, O
but O
next O
time O
you O
have O
to O
order O
more O
than O
2 O
appitizers U-NEU
and O
a O
main O
course O
! O

the O
menu U-POS
looked O
great O
, O
but O
the O
food U-NEG
was O
the O
biggest O
disappointment O
i O
've O
had O
yet O
! O

We O
waited O
in O
standing O
at O
the O
entrance O
for O
5 O
mins O
to O
get O
seats O
due O
to O
just O
slow O
service U-NEG
, O
another O
10mins O
to O
get O
menu U-NEU
, O
and O
then O
another O
10mins O
to O
get O
water O
bread U-NEU
. O

The O
wait B-POS
staff L-POS
is O
very O
attentive O
, O
and O
you O
can O
smoke O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
while O
enjoying O
the O
view O
of O
the O
river O
. O

I O
complained O
to O
the O
manager U-NEG
who O
offered O
to O
move O
us O
and O
pay O
for O
our O
appetizers U-NEU
. O

We O
were O
not O
seated O
by O
a O
hostess U-NEG
( O
and O
as O
a O
result O
did O
n't O
receive O
menus U-NEU
or O
water O
for O
a O
good O
while O
) O
and O
were O
rushed O
out O
as O
the O
restaurant O
closed O
an O
hour O
after O
we O
arrived O
. O

When O
I O
requested O
a O
change O
to O
the O
non O
- O
smoking O
section O
, O
the O
waiter U-NEU
replied O
that O
there O
were O
no O
open O
tables U-NEG
. O

When O
we O
showed O
up O
, O
the O
guy U-NEG
at O
the O
door O
said O
it O
would O
be O
15 O
minutes O
and O
that O
we O
could O
wait O
by O
the O
bar U-NEU
. O

Caffeine O
addicts O
will O
have O
to O
find O
their O
fix O
elsewhere O
as O
coffee O
is O
curiously O
not O
on O
the O
menu U-NEU
, O
but O
the O
Singha O
beer O
and O
decent O
wine B-POS
list L-POS
more O
than O
compensates O
. O

Good O
value B-POS
for I-POS
money L-POS
-- O
especially O
the O
$ O
7 O
lunch O
special O
for O
2 O
courses U-NEU
. O

Dinner U-NEG
is O
a O
tad O
dodgy O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
eat O
meat U-NEU
or O
fish O
. O

The O
food U-POS
is O
decent O
but O
small O
portions U-NEG
so O
expect O
to O
order O
a O
lot O
. O

Comfort U-NEG
is O
decidedly O
not O
a O
factor O
in O
the O
Arturo O
's O
experience O
-- O
once O
patrons O
escape O
the O
bottleneck O
near O
the O
bar U-NEU
, O
they O
're O
shoehorned O
into O
a O
miniscule O
dining O
room O
. O

Then O
the O
huffy O
hostess U-NEG
when O
we O
asked O
to O
be O
seated O
at O
a O
table U-NEU
not O
directly O
on O
- O
top O
of O
another O
couple O
. O

Remember O
the O
80 O
's O
when O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
1 O
- O
2 O
hours O
for O
a O
table U-NEU
even O
though O
you O
have O
a O
reservation U-NEU
+ O
the O
wait B-NEG
staff L-NEG
treated O
you O
like O
the O
idiot O
that O
you O
are O
for O
paying O
$ O
2 O
- O
300 O
per O
head O
for O
this O
treatment O
, O
then O
you O
should O
definately O
come O
to O
experience O
this O
jewel O
! O
! O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
food U-POS
was O
good O
but O
not O
awesome O
as O
had O
been O
described O
, O
furthermore O
I O
found O
the O
portions U-NEG
fairly O
small O
for O
this O
type O
of O
restaurant O
. O

The O
owner U-POS
Don O
greeted O
us O
at O
the O
door O
with O
a O
warm O
smile O
, O
and O
seated O
us O
for O
dinner U-NEU
upstairs O
. O

Our O
waitress U-NEG
could O
n't O
tell O
us O
what O
was O
in O
the O
seafood O
special O
, O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
our O
oyster O
order O
so O
it O
came O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
the O
main B-NEU
meals L-NEU
, O
was O
n't O
able O
to O
provide O
a O
confident O
recommendation O
from O
the O
menu U-NEU
, O
and O
had O
to O
be O
flagged O
several O
times O
for O
drinks U-NEU
. O

Went O
for O
an O
early O
V B-NEU
- I-NEU
Day I-NEU
dinner L-NEU
, O
only O
to O
be O
highly O
disappointed O
by O
the O
service U-NEG
. O

Staff U-NEG
would O
not O
change O
a O
meal U-NEU
to O
accomadidate O
food U-NEU
allegeries O
. O

We O
waited O
FOREVER O
on O
Valentine O
's O
Day O
for O
our O
table U-NEU
because O
their O
hostess U-NEG
had O
lost O
our O
reservation O
BUT O
the O
food U-POS
was O
worthy O
of O
the O
long O
wait B-NEG
anyway L-NEG
. O

Flavorful O
Indian O
favorites O
like O
vegetable B-NEU
pakora L-NEU
, O
lamb B-NEU
tikka I-NEU
masala I-NEU
and I-NEU
tandoori I-NEU
chicken L-NEU
, O
as O
well O
as O
unexpected O
offerings O
such O
as O
Alaska B-NEU
king I-NEU
crab I-NEU
legs I-NEU
and I-NEU
fried I-NEU
coconut I-NEU
shrimp L-NEU
, O
are O
served O
at O
extremely O
reasonable O
prices U-POS
. O

The O
food U-POS
is O
on O
the O
good O
side O
but O
not O
so O
terrific O
to O
compensate O
the O
bad O
service U-NEG
, O
crammed O
tiny O
- O
tables O
, O
dirty O
glasses U-NEG
, O
overly O
loud O
music O
, O
which O
is O
good O
for O
the O
bar O
part O
of O
the O
establishment O
but O
not O
when O
you O
want O
to O
seat O
down O
, O
eat O
and O
have O
a O
normal O
conversation O
at O
normal O
volume O
. O

I O
was O
disappointed O
to O
hear O
another O
waiter U-NEG
( O
or O
it O
could O
've O
been O
the O
owner U-NEG
) O
was O
reading O
completely O
different O
specials U-NEU
( O
most O
of O
which O
I O
would O
've O
wanted O
to O
try O
if O
I O
did O
n't O
overhear O
at O
the O
end O
of O
our O
meal O
) O
to O
the O
table O
next O
to O
us O
. O

our O
waiter U-POS
from O
last O
year O
, O
a O
young O
man O
named O
Chris O
, O
actually O
remembered O
us O
( O
we O
did O
speak O
at O
length O
that O
evening O
about O
everything O
from O
food O
and O
wine U-NEU
to O
how O
to O
create O

As O
a O
chef U-NEU
I O
really O
appreciated O
the O
well O
executed O
dishes U-POS
that O
were O
full O
of O
crisp O
and O
vibrant O
flavor U-POS
contrast O
acting O
in O
harmony O
and O
perfect O
balance O
. O

The O
service U-NEG
can O
be O
a O
bit O
spotty O
since O
they O
are O
sometimes O
busy O
taking O
phone O
orders O
to O
attend O
to O
the O
restaurant O
patrons O
so O
make O
sure O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
to O
spare O
when O
you O
go O
there O
for O
dinner U-NEU
. O

atmosphere U-NEG
is O
not O
that O
relaxing O
, O
if O
you O
go O
- O
you O
MUST O
bring O
a O
cell O
phone O
and O
go O
down O
the O
street O
for O
a O
drink U-NEU
. O

This O
pizza U-POS
shop O
is O
one O
o O
fhte O
best O
places O
ever O
and O
is O
a O
hiden O
gem O
in O
a O
small O
community U-NEG
. O

After O
being O
seated O
outside O
by O
the O
host U-NEU
, O
a O
waitress U-NEG
came O
over O
and O
yelled O
at O
us O
for O
taking O
a O
table O
that O
belonged O
to O
people O
waiting U-NEU
at O
the O
bar O
. O

after O
booking O
reservations U-NEU
at O
Danube O
, O
only O
to O
show O
up O
and O
not O
have O
any O
tables U-NEG
available O
, O
the O
Danube O
somelier O
graciously O
called O
over O
to O
Bouley O
and O
got O

and O
a O

shelf I-POS
roasted I-POS
chicken L-POS
with O
rapini O
and O

I O
was O
a O
bit O
taken O
aback O
by O
the O
paper O
napkins O
and O
the O
flyer U-NEU
like O
menu U-NEU
, O
but O
was O
excited O
nevertheless O
to O
taste O
the O
food U-POS
praised O
by O
at O
least O
6 O
people O
on O
this O
site O
. O

The O
tables U-NEG
were O
n't O
bussed O
and O
they O
forgot O
to O
make O
my O
chai O
tea O
, O
which O
was O
n't O
all O
that O
delicious O
, O
not O
was O
my O
friend O
's O
coffee U-POS
. O

Service U-POS
is O
FAST O
so O
if O
you O
are O
dining O
, O
order O
entrees U-NEU
after O
receiving O
apps O
. O

Upon O
finishing O
our O
meal O
that O
same O
waitress U-NEG
that O
ignored O
us O
, O
suddenly O
appeared O
at O
our O
table O
asking O
if O
we O
needed O
our O
check O
, O
we O
were O
finishing O
our O
coffee O
and O
drinks U-NEU
, O
yet O
she O
was O
blatantly O
trying O
to O
get O
us O
out O
so O
that O
the O
table O
could O
be O
turned O
over O
. O

The O
kinds O
of O
places O
like O
this O
where O
strangers O
are O
likely O
to O
share O
a O
table O
during O
the O
lunch U-NEU
rush O
always O
have O
better O
food U-POS
than O
the O
Table O
- O
cloth O
places O
. O

You O
'll O
find O
classic O
PS450 B-POS
dishes L-POS
like O
the O
sliced B-POS
steak L-POS
atop O
creamed O
spinich O
on O
crunchy O
little O
toasts O
and O
new O
items U-POS
like O
brie O
poppers U-NEU
on O
drizzled O
strawberry O
- O
infused O
sauce U-NEU
. O

Our O
waiter U-NEU
recommended O
thZt O
we O
share O
a O
few O
of O
the O
appetizers U-POS
; O
they O
were O
great O
. O

I O
went O
here O
for O
a O
fun O
dinner U-NEG
with O
friends O
- O
they O
do O
not O
take O
reservations O
during O
the O
week O
, O
but O
we O
were O
seated O
pretty O
swiftly O
for O
a O
Friday O
night O
, O
having O
had O
a O
delicious O
glass B-POS
of I-POS
Spanish I-POS
wine L-POS
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
. O

We O
were O
just O
settling O
the O
bill U-NEU
, O
when O
a O
waiter U-NEG
I O
can O
only O
assume O
held O
a O
controlling O
interest O
in O
the O
restaurant O
( O
else O
he O
would O
've O
been O
fired O
long O
ago O
) O
came O
to O
the O
table O
and O
demanded O
to O
know O
why O
someone O
( O
our O
friend O
who O
'd O
briefly O
left O
to O
use O
the O
restroom O
) O
had O
left O
her O
beer O
half B-NEU
- I-NEU
full L-NEU
. O

My O
only O
gripe O
was O
that O
the O
food O
was O
all O
in O
big O
bins O
, O
but O
that O
's O
expected O
for O
a O
lunch U-NEU
rush O
hour O
type O
crowd U-NEG
. O

I O
've O
been O
here O
twice O
for O
brunch U-NEU
, O
and O
I O
found O
the O
ambience U-POS
and O
food O
to O
be O
much O
better O
than O
the O
overly O
- O
hyped O
Kitchenette O
next O
door O
. O

The O
food U-POS
is O
just O
ok O
, O
not O
really O
memorable O
and O
not O
what O
you O
expect O
for O
the O
price U-NEG
but O
I O
guess O
the O
atmosphere U-POS
is O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

What O
I O
liked O
the O
most O
is O
that O
the O
staff U-POS
listened O
attentively O
to O
what O
I O
asked O
for O
and O
my O
meal U-NEU
was O
prepared O
EXACTLY O
the O
way O
I O
asked O
, O
what O
a O
treat O
. O

The O
drinks U-NEU
were O
water O
down O
and O
the O
only O
BIG O
thing O
was O
the O
bill U-NEG
. O

Its O
not O
cheap O
, O
it O
was O
$ O
10 O
for O
a O
burger U-NEU
and O
fries O
, O
and O
when O
i O
was O
there O
, O
the O
waiter U-NEG
had O
dropped O
a O
FULL O
glass U-NEU
of O
coke O
on O
a O
patron O
, O
soaking O
her O
through O
! O

Our O
bill U-NEU
total O
was O
only O
$ O
30 O
and O
our O
waiter U-NEG
threw O
in O
a O
side O
of O
linguini O
( O
no O
charge O
) O
since O
the O
entrees U-NEG
do O
n't O
come O
with O
pasta B-NEU
sides L-NEU
. O

The O
reservation U-POS
was O
easy O
enough O
to O
make O
the O
night O
before O
for O
a O
Saturday O
night O
( O
after O
the O
pre O
- O
theater O
crowd U-NEU
) O
. O

There O
was O
3 O
baby B-NEU
carrots L-NEU
, O
a O
spoon O
full O
of O
spinach U-POS
, O
sun B-NEU
dried I-NEU
tomatoes L-NEU
, O
3 O
pieces O
of O
eggplant U-NEU
, O
and O
10 O
string O
beans O
, O
oh O
and O
onions U-NEU
. O

Last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
the O
chef U-POS
made O
me O
a O
special O
dessert U-POS
called O
yokan U-NEU
( O
red O
bean O
cake O
with O
strawberry O
sauce O
on O
top O
) O
and O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
eating O
great O
thai B-POS
food L-POS
in O
a O
schnazzy O
ambience U-NEU
with O
a O
hop O
hip O
lunch B-NEU
crowd L-NEU
, O
then O
come O
on O
over O
to O
SPICE O
. O

Decor U-POS
is O
sort O
of O
homey O
, O
with O
mismatched O
tables U-NEG
and O
plates O
. O

Generally O
one O
would O
have O
to O
point O
out O
to O
the O
waitstaff U-NEG
the O
beer U-NEU
was O
flat O
and O
ask O
for O
another O
. O

Though O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
about O
45 O
minutes O
from O
our O
dinner O
reservation O
time O
, O
we O
were O
given O
breadsticks O
, O
olives U-NEU
and O
parmasean O
to O
nibble O
on O
while O
we O
waited O
, O
albeit O
in O
the O
very O
cramped O
bar B-NEG
area L-NEG
. O

Finally O
, O
one O
of O
the O
waitstaff U-NEG
noticed O
and O
brought O
out O
a O
dirty O
bus O
pan O
which O
he O
put O
on O
the O
table O
next O
to O
me O
and O
started O
bussing O
the O
entire O
dining B-NEU
room L-NEU
. O

We O
sat O
soaked O
in O
red B-NEU
wine L-NEU
for O
20 O
minutes O
eating O
our O
meals U-NEU
w/o O
the O
wine O
b O
/ O
c O
the O
server U-NEG
saw O
us O
like O
that O
but O
did O
nothing O
until O
we O
stopped O
him O
. O

Our O
party O
of O
4 O
ordered O
only O
appetizers U-NEU
( O
about O
6 O
of O
them O
) O
and O
made O
a O
wonderful O
meal U-POS
out O
of O
it O
. O

In O
addition O
guys O
, O
please O
hire O
some O
waitstaff U-NEG
who O
know O
both O
English O
and O
your O
menu U-NEU
. O

The O
menu U-NEU
features O
such O
sumptuous O
fare U-POS
as O
lobster B-NEU
ravioli I-NEU
in I-NEU
a I-NEU
light I-NEU
aurora I-NEU
sauce L-NEU
, O
double B-NEU
- I-NEU
cut I-NEU
grilled I-NEU
veal I-NEU
chop L-NEU
with O
an O
aromatic B-NEU
salsa I-NEU
verde L-NEU
, O
and O
octopus B-NEU
salad I-NEU
with I-NEU
steamed I-NEU
potato I-NEU
, I-NEU
red I-NEU
onions L-NEU
, O
and O
caper O
berries U-NEU
. O

The O
soft B-POS
shell I-POS
chicken I-POS
taco L-POS
is O
alright O
, O
but O
nobody O
would O
go O
here O
for O
serious O
Mexican B-NEG
food L-NEG
. O

I O
asked O
the O
waitress U-NEG
what O
this O
was O
for O
and O
her O
responses O
were O
as O
follows O
: O
We O
put O
in O
an O
extra O
shot O
, O
We O
had O
to O
use O
ice O
in O
the O
drink U-NEU
, O
and O
It O
must O
have O
been O
the O
computer O
. O

The O
bill U-NEU
came O
out O
to O
quite O
a O
lot O
though O
, O
considering O
there O
were O
14 O
of O
us O
some O
of O
us O
ordered O
way O
too O
many O
drinks U-POS
. O

Although O
the O
waitress U-NEG
had O
clearly O
our O
reservation U-NEU
on O
her O
book O
, O
she O
told O
us O
somebody O
arrived O
one O
minute O
ago O
and O
being O
first O
to O
arrive O
, O
he O
could O
have O
our O
table O
. O

The O
Food O
Guiltily O
scarf O
down O
fried B-POS
catfish I-POS
sandwiches L-POS
and O
collard B-NEU
greens L-NEU
, O
or O
try O
Clinton O
's O
favorite O
: O
short O
ribs U-POS
and O
fried B-POS
chicken L-POS
. O

The O
waitress U-NEG
took O
about O
20 O
minutes O
to O
bring O
us O
the O
menu U-NEU
. O

After O
arriving O
an O
hour O
early O
for O
our O
reservation U-NEU
for O
2 O
and O
politely O
asking O
for O
a O
table O
near O
the O
band U-NEU
we O
were O
promptly O
seated O
at O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
tables U-NEG
in O
the O
place O
. O

we O
ordered O
simple O
salads U-NEU
, O
which O
were O
outrageous O
in O
price U-POS
and O
def O
. O

It O
's O
just O
nice O
to O
have O
a O
place O
like O
this O
- O
a O
sit O
down O
place O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
food B-POS
choices L-POS
, O
not O
centered O
on O
a O
particular O
ethnicity O
and O
a O
bar U-NEU
- O
as O
an O
option O
here O
. O

There O
were O
a O
few O
moments U-NEU
during O
the O
tasting O
menu U-POS
that O
left O
me O
speechless O
, O
such O
as O
the O
shrimp B-POS
in I-POS
cream I-POS
sauce L-POS
, O
toro O
with O
foam O
, O
foie O
gras O
custard O
, O
eggplant B-POS
in I-POS
miso L-POS
and O
a O
foie O
gras O
kobe O
beef O
filet O
fried O
ball O
that O
brought O
me O
to O
tears O
. O

All O
dishes U-NEU
have O
been O
adjusted O
for O
American O
preferences O
( O
bland O
, O
missing O
spices U-NEG
and O
wok O
heat O
) O
. O

There O
is O
almost O
always O
an O
hour O
wait O
at O
dinner U-NEU
time O
, O
but O
this O
may O
be O
the O
best O
Japanese U-POS
Sushi O
restaurant O
in O
NYC O
. O

We O
waited O
forever O
for O
our O
bill U-NEG
but O
did O
have O
a O
nice O
conversation O
with O
one O
of O
our O
waitstaff U-POS
during O
our O
meal O
. O

Watch O
out O
for O
the O
sesame B-NEG
noodles L-NEG
, O
though O
, O
and O
leave O
the O
complimentary O
pickled O
cabbage O
and O
carrots O
sitting O
on O
the O
table U-NEU
for O
the O
next O
customer O
to O
enjoy O
. O

My O
fiance O
and O
I O
always O
get O
mussels U-NEU
a O
la O
Cono O
and O
linguine O
a O
la O
Cono O
, O
but O
all O
the O
other O
pasta B-POS
dishes L-POS
I O
've O
tried O
have O
been O
good O
or O
excellent O
. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
the O
atmosphere U-POS
was O
nothing O
amazing O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
feel O
like O
the O
authenticity O
of O
the O
history O
of O
the O
place U-NEU
was O
nearly O
as O
prevelant O
as O
it O
could O
have O
been O
in O
the O
experience O
. O

If O
it O
's O
not O
on O
the O
menu U-NEU
, O
ask O
for O
the O
string B-POS
bean I-POS
and I-POS
goat I-POS
cheese L-POS
salad- O
delicious O
. O

I O
had O
a O
party O
of O
9 O
reservation U-NEU
and O
was O
very O
disappointed O
at O
the O
service U-NEG
. O

Fifteen O
minutes O
later O
, O
when O
we O
asked O
about O
our O
drinks U-NEU
, O
another O
server U-NEG
went O
to O
investigate O
and O
found O
that O
they O
'd O
run O
out O
of O
one O
of O
the O
liqueurs O
they O
needed O
and O
had O
gone O
out O
to O
get O
more O
-- O
which O
is O
fine O
, O
but O
it O
would O
've O
been O
nice O
to O
know O
. O

WHen O
I O
politely O
asked O
for O
a O
water U-NEU
he O
pointed O
to O
the O
waiter U-NEG
and O
looked O
the O
other O
way O
! O

Waiters U-NEG
take O
your O
order O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
get O
your O
food U-NEU
for O
at O
least O
1 O
hour O
so O
you O
can O
prchase O
drinks U-NEU
. O

Frustrated O
, O
hand O
the O
check U-NEU
back O
to O
the O
server U-NEG
and O
said O
' O
by O
the O
way O
, O
never O
got O
the O
dessert O
and O
he O
said O
i O
did O
not O
realize O
you O
wanted O
dessert O
' O

We O
got O
so O
frustrated O
with O
our O
waitress U-NEG
, O
who O
stopped O
by O
twice O
over O
the O
course O
of O
2 O
1/2 O
hours O
, O
that O
we O
had O
to O
order O
everything O
from O
the O
bar U-NEU
. O

The O
complete O
and O
total O
rudeness O
and O
frustration O
surrounding O
this O
place O
started O
with O
the O
hostess U-NEG
calling O
us O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
afternoon U-NEU
asking O
if O
we O
could O
change O
our O
reservation U-NEU
. O

However O
, O
the O
appetizers U-POS
I O
've O
tried O
( O
rolls U-NEU
, O
calamari U-NEU
, O
fish U-NEU
fingers O
) O
were O
really O
delicious O
. O

service O
was O
reasonably O
quick O
via O
delivery U-POS
, O
but O
the O
hunan B-NEG
beef L-NEG
had O
no O
spice O
whatsoever O
and O
the O
chicken O
chow O
mein O
really O
looked O
inedible O
. O

Go O
have O
a O
drink O
there O
the O
space U-POS
is O
beautiful O
and O
buy O
an O
appetizer U-NEU
maybe O
, O
but O
pass O
on O
dinner U-NEU
, O
not O
well O
cooked O
and O
small O
portions U-NEG
. O

The O
steaks U-POS
are O
just O
as O
good O
, O
with O
an O
assortment U-NEU
of O
tasty O
side B-POS
dishes L-POS
that O
make O
Peter O
Luger O
's O
menu U-NEU
look O
like O
the O
slip O
in O
a O
fortune O
cookie O
. O

Food U-NEU
was O
so O
- O
so O
, O
but O
it O
was O
the O
most O
awful O
dinner U-NEG
I O
experienced O
in O
my O
life O
. O

For O
a O
menu O
in O
a O
similar O
price B-NEU
range L-NEU
with O
some O
similar O
items O
, O
but O
mostly O
unique O
entrees U-POS
, O
try O
the O
less O
formal O
Toast O
13 O
or O
so O
blocks O
north O
on O
the O
same O
side O
of O
Broadway O
. O

The O
feeling O
of O
unwelcomeness O
was O
especially O
prevalent O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
our O
waiter U-NEG
hovered O
over O
our O
table O
and O
immediately O
cleared O
the O
table B-NEU
of I-NEU
dishes L-NEU
and O
glasses O
, O
some O
of O
which O
were O
still O
full O
in O
order O
to O
get O
us O
out O
the O
door O
ASAP O
. O

They O
seem O
under O
staffed O
and O
Waiters U-NEG
do O
not O
really O
know O
the O
menu U-NEU
. O

The O
manager U-NEG
( O
or O
someone O
very O
important O
that O
was O
able O
to O
be O
seated O
1/2 O
hour O
before O
opening O
) O
sat O
in O
the O
corner U-NEU
, O
with O
a O
glass B-NEU
of I-NEU
wine L-NEU
, O
a O
date O
, O
and O
talked O
on O
his O
cell O
for O
about O
an O
hour O
, O
loudly O
, O
while O
the O
first O
arrivals O
were O
sent O
to O
the O
hotel O
tearoom O
next O
door O
. O

It O
still O
took O
a O
little O
while O
to O
get O
our O
drinks U-NEU
and O
food O
- O
But O
the O
atmosphere U-POS
made O
up O
for O
it O
. O

Manager U-NEG
could O
n't O
be O
bothered O
to O
come O
over O
and O
acknowledge O
the O
mistake U-POS
. O

This O
place O
has O
great O
ribs U-POS
, O
not O
to O
mention O
hot O
waitresses U-POS
, O
its O
a O
great O
place O
to O
meet O
for O
drinks U-NEU
and O
dinner U-NEU
before O
you O
go O
out O
, O
but O
it O
does O
turn O
into O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
sausage B-NEU
fest L-NEU
on O
the O
weekends O
. O

You O
may O
as O
well O
just O
extend O
the O
bar U-NEU
into O
the O
restaurant O
since O
it O
has O
already O
penetrated O
it O
with O
loud O
music U-NEG
, O
loud O
voices O
, O
and O
a O
remarkable O
amount O
of O
cigarette O
smoke U-NEG
. O

After O
I O
had O
complained O
to O
a O
bouncer O
( O
the O
manager U-NEG
would O
not O
see O
me O
) O
a O
waiter U-NEG
was O
sent O
over O
and O
did O
get O
us O
our O
drinks U-NEU
. O

After O
waiting U-NEG
for O
90 O
minutes O
, O
the O
host U-NEU
gave O
away O
our O
table U-NEU
to O
a O
couple O
who O
arrived O
after O
us O
. O

We O
had O
to O
ask O
FIFTEEN O
TIMES O
for O
water U-NEU
, O
we O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
we O
were O
eating O
( O
due O
to O
incomprehensible O
serving B-NEG
staff L-NEG
) O
, O
waited O
25 O
minutes O
after O
asking O
for O
our O
bill O
, O
and O
were O
charged O
a O
20 O
% O
corking O
fee O
ON O
WINE O
WE O
BOUGHT O
THERE O
. O

The O
server U-POS
( O
Jasmine O
) O
checked O
up O
on O
us O
periodically O
and O
was O
patient O
as O
she O
explained O
certain O
menu B-NEU
items L-NEU
. O

The O
waitress U-NEG
saw O
a O
couple O
of O
us O
struggling O
with O
the O
menu U-NEU
and O
I O
felt O
she O
was O
frustrated O
with O
us O
. O

The O
service U-NEG
was O
unattentive O
and O
the O
only O
time O
she O
came O
over O
was O
to O
aggressively O
push O
drinks U-NEU
on O
us O
. O

However O
, O
unlike O
a O
lot O
of O
places O
the O
service U-POS
was O
great O
: O
we O
walked O
in O
after O
not O
being O
able O
to O
get O
a O
reservation U-NEU
and O
were O
seated O
within O
10 O
mins O
. O

I O
asked O
the O
waiter U-NEU
to O
move O
us O
to O
another O
table U-NEU
because O
we O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
rush O
our O
meal U-NEG
. O

The O
waitress U-NEG
was O
friendly O
but O
did O
not O
know O
the O
menu U-NEU
and O
had O
to O
run O
to O
the O
kitchen O
after O
each O
question O
. O

It O
is O
far O
more O
popular O
as O
a O
bar O
than O
as O
a O
restaurant O
, O
with O
only O
a O
few O
tables U-NEU
and O
the O
waiter O
being O
the O
bartender O
, O
but O
we O
greatly O
enjoyed O
the O
unobtrusive O
atmosphere U-POS
. O

The O
drinkers U-POS
beside O
us O
had O
fresh O
glasses O
of O
water O
brought O
on O
trays U-NEU
to O
replace O
the O
empties O
and O
a O
smiling O
waitress U-POS
to O
cater O
to O
their O
every O
whim O
. O

They O
ended O
up O
cramming O
10 O
of O
us O
on O
3 O
small O
tables U-NEG
, O
then O
taking O
forever O
with O
our O
food U-NEU
. O

I O
could O
not O
get O
a O
reservation U-NEU
on O
the O
phone O
and O
when O
I O
arrived O
they O
would O
not O
seat U-NEG
us O
even O
though O
they O
were O
half O
empty O
. O

I O
was O
told O
they O
had O
one(early O
) O
reservation U-NEU
; O
felt O
deceived O
b O
/ O
c O
when O
I O
left O
the O
place U-NEG
was O
empty O
! O

For O
appetizers O
, O
wine U-NEU
, O
dinner U-NEU
, O
desert U-NEU
, O
great O
convesation U-POS
, O
expect O
to O
spend O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
staff U-POS
are O
friendly O
but O
if O
you O
're O
unlucky O
enough O
to O
be O
served O
by O
the O
waitress U-NEG
that O
is O
n't O
, O
then O
the O
experience O
can O
be O
rather O
unpleasant O
. O

When O
after O
2 O
hours O
we O
did O
ask O
for O
our O
entrees U-NEU
, O
the O
waiter U-NEG
and O
busboy U-NEG
were O
both O
extremely O
rude O
. O

As O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu U-NEU
and O
the O
wine O
list O
, O
my O
friend O
overheard O
the O
manager U-NEG
comment O
to O
a O
waitress O
about O
me O
that O
the O
least O
he O
could O
do O
is O
wear O
a O
button O
down O
shirt O
, O
and O
not O
show O
up O
dressed O
like O
a O
Gristede O
's O
boxcutter O

I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
trash O
the O
place U-NEG
simply O
because O
I O
had O
a O
bad O
experience O
there O
, O
but O
here O
's O
the O
facts O
: O
the O
food U-POS
is O
very O
good O
, O
the O
portions U-NEG
are O
small O
- O
to O
- O
medium O
, O
and O
the O
prices U-NEG
are O
large O
. O

Spoke O
with O
the O
manager U-NEG
about O
comping O
a O
round O
, O
after O
we O
had O
already O
paid O
for O
2 O
rounds O
waiting U-NEU
for O
the O
table U-NEU
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
loved O
Imagine O
Bar U-POS
and O
Grill U-NEU
. O

The O
food U-POS
at O
Cafe O
Asean O
is O
to O
die O
for O
, O
and O
the O
prices U-NEG
are O
unmatchable O
. O

Our O
waitress U-NEU
recommended O
the O
coffee B-POS
flan L-POS
for O
dessert U-POS
, O
and O
we O
did O
n't O
regret O
it O
. O

Food U-POS
was O
fresh O
yet O
dull O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
price U-NEU
( O

I O
would O
also O
recommend O
the O
garlic B-POS
bread L-POS
for O
a O
starter U-NEU
. O

The O
waiter U-NEG
brought O
out O
the O
same O
dish O
three O
times O
during O
the O
meal U-NEU

Students O

-- O
the O
place O
closes O
way O
too O
early O
to O
lure O
a O
late O
- O
night O
crowd O
. O

Our O
waitress O
had O
no O
clue O
about O
the O
menu U-NEG
and O
( O
after O
we O
had O
ordered O
a O
bottle B-NEU
of I-NEU
wine L-NEU
) O
told O
us O
the O
kitchen U-NEU
was O
closing O
and O
stood O
guard O
until O
we O
ordered O
. O

The O
waiter U-POS
was O
able O
to O
answer O
any O
questions O
I O
had O
about O
the O
wine U-NEU
or O
food U-NEU
. O

IT O
'S O
GREAT O
COFFEE U-POS
BUT O
THE O
SERVICE U-NEG
IS O
SERVED U-NEU
WITH O
BIG O
TIME O
ATTITUDE O
. O

Once O
they O
took O
our O
wine U-NEU
order O
, O
it O
took O
45 O
minutes O
for O
it O
to O
arrive O
, O
even O
though O
the O
waiter U-NEG
was O
talking O
to O
a O
patron O
next O
to O
us O
. O

I O
would O
only O
go O
back O
for O
a O
lobster B-POS
roll L-POS
at O
lunch U-NEU
. O

The O
ambience O
and O
service U-POS
here O
are O
great O
but O
the O
food U-NEG
was O
really O
awful O
. O

For O
a O
4-star O
restaurant O
( O
not O
to O
mention O
a O
$ O
400 O
dinner U-NEU
for O
two O
) O
, O
attentive O
service U-POS
is O
expected O
. O

Our O
waiter U-NEG
( O
who O
also O
seemed O
to O
be O
the O
manager U-NEG
) O
dropped O
red O
wine O
all O
over O
me O
the O
contents O
of O
my O
purse O
and O
all O
he O
did O
was O
apologize O
quickly O
, O
hand O
me O
some O
club B-NEU
soda L-NEU
and O
avoid O
me O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
time O
I O
was O
there O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
was O
the O
ginger B-NEG
iced I-NEG
tea L-NEG
was O
too O
sugary O
- O
but O
the O
home B-POS
- I-POS
made I-POS
fresh I-POS
lemonade L-POS
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
fresh O
. O

Beyond O
the O
green O
awning O
and O
floor O
- O
to O
- O
ceiling O
windows O
, O
sophisticated O
( O
and O
often O
European O
) O
patrons O
drink B-NEU
wine L-NEU
from O
the O
bar U-NEU
in O
back O
and O
dine U-NEU
on O
French B-NEU
fare L-NEU
like O
nicoise O
salad O
, O
foie O
gras O
, O
and O
steak B-NEU
tartare L-NEU
at O
tightly O
packed O
tables U-NEG
. O

Definitely O
try O
their O
Pizzas U-POS
and O
Wines U-POS
-- O
although O
their O
desserts U-NEG
are O
not O
- O
to O
- O
shabby O
either O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
steak U-NEU
for O
four O
and O
some O
side O
dishes O
( O
the O
cream B-NEG
spinach L-NEG
was O
a O
bit O
salty O
, O
but O
the O
German B-POS
fries L-POS
was O
really O
good O
) O
. O

For O
entrees U-NEU
, O
Manzo O
, O
melt O
in O
your O
mouth O
beef O
medallions O
complemented O
by O
plump O
, O
sweet O
raisins B-POS
+ I-POS
spinach L-POS
. O

Too O
bad O
the O
food U-NEU
and O
service U-NEG
are O
n't O
nearly O
as O
nice O
as O
the O
decor U-POS
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
go O
there O
only O
go O
for O
drinks U-NEU
and O
the O
atmosphere O
b O
/ O
c O
the O
food U-NEG
is O
definitly O
not O
worth O
it O
! O
! O

The O
appetizers U-POS
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
entrees U-POS
were O
superb O
( O
the O
mahi U-NEG
was O
a O
little O
bland O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
you O
ca O
n't O
win O
them O
all O
) O
. O

The O
ambience U-NEG
is O
n't O
great O
but O
the O
food U-POS
is O
so O
tasty O
and O
so O
reasonably O
priced U-POS
that O
it O
's O
definitely O
a O
fun O
date O
place O
if O
you O
want O
to O
get O
a O
bunch O
of O
stuff O
and O
sample O
. O

Oh O
, O
the O
prices U-POS
were O
not O
so O
bad O
either O
, O
we O
paid O
$ O
58 O
for O
chicken O
, O
salmon U-NEU
, O
one O
sushi O
roll O
, O
one O
ceasar O
salad O
and O
soda U-NEU
:) O
. O

The O
food U-NEU
is O
average O
the O
prices U-NEG
high O
and O
the O
whole O
experience O
was O
very O
upsetting O
. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
30 O
minutes O
before O
the O
waiter U-NEG
even O
came O
to O
our O
table O
and O
had O
to O
ask O
4 O
times O
just O
to O
get O
a O
glass B-NEU
of I-NEU
water L-NEU
. O

The O
ice B-POS
cream L-POS
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal U-NEU
was O
a O
surprise O
and O
I O
loved O
it O
. O

Chicken B-POS
options L-POS
are O
fantastic O
, O
notably O
chicken O
with O
spices U-NEU
. O

The O
wine B-NEG
list L-NEG
did O
n't O
look O
all O
that O
great O
, O
but O
there O
was O
a O
very O
interesting O
selection O
of O
beers U-POS
on O
tap U-NEU
. O

The O
food U-POS
was O
of O
a O
relatively O
high O
standard O
, O
except O
the O
oysters U-NEG
seemed O
a O
little O
off O
. O

Good O
food U-POS
, O
but O
bad O
service U-NEG
. O

Oh O
yeah O
, O
the O
food U-POS
's O
just O
alright O
for O
the O
price U-NEU
. O

Further O
, O
our O
waiter U-NEG
was O
basically O
inattentive O
through O
the O
entire O
dinner U-NEU
( O
e. O

Our O
waitress U-POS
was O
pleasent O
and O
patient O
as O
we O
asked O
about O
all O
the O
various O
types O
of O
sushi U-NEU
. O

My O
boyfriend O
's O
halibut U-NEG
was O
slightly O
undercooked O
, O
so O
he O
sent O
it O
back O
-- O
the O
result O
was O
not O
only O
a O
fresh O
piece O
of O
perfectly O
cooked O
fish O
, O
but O
also O
a O
complimentary O
spread U-NEG
of O
FOUR O
desserts U-NEU
! O

I O
went O
back O
a O
different O
night O
, O
once O
again O
I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
which O
, O
probably O
Friday O
and O
the O
place U-NEU
was O
a O
ghost O
town O
, O
with O
a O
corny O
DJ O
and O
a O
waitress U-NEG
who O
could O
n't O
get O
my O
friend O
's O
drink U-NEU
right O
after O
several O
tries O
. O

Our O
waitress U-NEG
took O
our O
order O
and O
then O
NEVER O
came O
back O
to O
our O
table U-NEU
. O

For O
appetizers U-NEU
we O
ordered O
Chicken O
Samosas O
and O
Lasooni O
Gobi O
and O
for O
main O
course O
we O
ordered O
Chicken B-POS
Tikka I-POS
Masala L-POS
, O
Lamb B-POS
Pasanda L-POS
and O
Saag B-POS
Paneer L-POS
they O
were O
all O
just O
scrumptious O
. O

The O
atmosphere U-POS
was O
nice O
in O
the O
front O
room O
, O
but O
despite O
a O
reservation U-NEU
, O
we O
were O
relegated O
to O
the O
rear O
, O
where O
we O
were O
treated O
like O
stepchildren O
- O
we O
had O
to O
flag O
someone O
down O
to O
take O
our O
order O
, O
water O
with O
no O
ice O
, O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
extras O
( O
as O
opposed O
to O
someone O
asking O
if O
we O
needed O
something O
else O
) O
. O

The O
owner U-POS
addressed O
me O
by O
my O
first O
name O
after O
my O
second O
visit O
The O
garlic B-POS
shrimp L-POS
is O
a O
hit O
and O
the O
Sangria O
( O
the O
bartender U-POS
on O
Fridays O
mixes O
the O
drink U-NEU
in O
three O
ways O
) O
. O

Sure O
, O
the O
waitresses U-POS
are O
hot O
, O
but O
you O
'll O
have O
to O
wait O
30 O
minutes O
just O
to O
get O
your O
drinks U-NEU
. O

The O
guy U-POS
was O
pleasant O
and O
friendly O
but O
that O
only O
goes O
so O
far O
when O
you O
are O
hungry O
and O
have O
to O
wait O
2 O
hours O
for O
a O
pizza U-NEU
. O

Try O
the O

and I-POS
bacon I-POS
hash L-POS
with O
a O
perfectly O
spicy O
bloody O
or O
two O
, O
what O
a O
brunch U-NEU
should O
be O
. O

The O
food U-POS
is O
worth O
it O
, O
but O
I O
suggest O
you O
order O
delivery U-NEU
, O
so O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
read O
old O
issues O
of O
Robb O
Report O
while O
you O
wait O
forever O
in O
a O
small O
and O
hot O
room U-NEG

helpful O
in O
suggesting O
us O
drinks U-NEU
and O
helped O
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
dishes U-POS
since O
we O
knew O
nothing O
about O
Indian B-NEU
food L-NEU
. O

Try O
the O
blk B-POS
fettucine L-POS
with O
the O
lobster U-NEU
or O
the O
cioppino U-NEU
. O

Then O
the O
waiter U-NEG
acted O
indignant O
when O
we O
called O
him O
out O
for O
bring O
us O
the O
wrong O
( O
later O
) O
vintage O
of O
wine U-NEU
we O
picked O
out O
. O

The O
Sushi O
was O
of O
the O
highest O
caliber O
, O
the O
cut O
as O
if O
a O
master O
samurai O
marks O
smith O
was O
behind O
the O
bar U-NEU
, O
and O
service U-NEU
, O
just O
what O
you O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
fine O
dining O
establishment U-POS
, O
New O
York O
style O
. O

Waitress U-NEG
we O
had O
appered O
to O
be O
very O
impatient O
, O
did O
n't O
know O
the O
name O
of O
the O
fish O
in O
English O
, O
apptizer O
came O
when O
we O
were O
having O
entree U-NEU
and O
she O
made O
no O
apology O
. O

The O
food U-POS
is O
definitely O
the O
attraction O
, O
but O
the O
service U-NEG
has O
been O
consistently O
bad O
on O
every O
visit O
. O

I O
excused O
myself O
from O
my O
table O
went O
downstairs O
to O
inform O
the O
hostess U-POS
that O
I O
would O
like O
to O
suprise O
my O
dinner U-NEU
guest O
by O
recognizing O
his O
birthday O
in O
a O
very O
understated O
way O
. O

The O
Filet B-POS
Mignon L-POS
is O
awesome O
, O
along O
with O
everything O
else O
on O
the O
menu U-NEU
. O

) O
And O
do O
n't O
forget O
the O
svc O
, O
those O
waiters U-NEG
stare O
at O
you O
your O
entire O
meal U-NEU
, O
just O
waiting U-NEU
for O
you O
to O
put O
your O
fork U-NEU
down O
and O
they O
snatch O
the O
plate O
away O
in O
a O
second O
. O

The O
waitress U-NEG
really O
struggled O
with O
anything O
more O
complicated O
than O
that O
-- O
not O
sure O
if O
it O
was O
a O
language O
problem O
or O
what O
, O
but O
3 O
of O
the O
4 O
drinks U-NEG
we O
ordered O
came O
both O
late O
and O
wrong O
, O
including O
beer U-NEU
brought O
in O
place O
of O
a O
cocktail U-NEU
, O
the O
wrong O
wine U-NEG
, O
and O
a O
mystery B-NEU
drink L-NEU
that O
nobody O
had O
ordered O
. O

While O
getting O
a O
reservation U-NEU
upstairs O
can O
be O
a O
pain O
, O
stopping O
by O
on O
Saturday O
night O
for O
a O
dinner U-POS
by O
the B-NEU
window L-NEU
is O
a O
fun O
way O
to O
experience O
Babbo O
without O
the O
long O
term O
planning O
. O

The O
Scene U-POS
Uncomplicated O
, O
tasteful O
touches O
-- O
a O
soothing O
abstract O
painting O
, O
an O
exposed O
brick O
wall O
, O
a O
tiny O
bar U-NEG
-- O
grace O
the O
restaurant O
's O
neutral O
- O
toned O
interior U-POS

Freshly O
shucked O
oysters O
and O

appeal O
to O
purists O
, O
while O
classicists O
order O
crisp O

- O
meat O
lump B-POS
crab I-POS

and O
chopped B-NEU

salads L-NEU
. O

One O
price U-NEG
for O
dinner U-NEU
left O
for O
no O
surprises O
. O

The O
burritos U-POS
are O
so O
great O
, O
I O
crave O
them O
while O
I O
am O
sitting O
at O
my O
desk O
and O
dreaming O
about O
lunch U-NEU
. O

Dishes U-POS
are O
best O
shared O
with O
groups O
, O
as O
are O
the O
pitchers O
of O
sangria U-NEU
. O

I O
lived O
next O
door O
and O
loved O
to O
go O
down O
for O
a O
drink O
at O
their O
uplit O
marble O
bar U-NEU
under O
the O
beautiful O
lighting U-POS
or O
sit O
by O
the O
fireplace O
when O
the O
live B-NEU
band L-NEU
is O
not O
playing O
. O

Not O
the O
most O
beautiful O
environment U-NEG
, O
but O
the O
food U-POS
is O
consistently O
delicious O
and O
the O
barbeque O
is O
fun O
and O
tasty O
. O

And O
the O
waiter U-NEG
actually O
replied O
, O
yes O
that O
's O
why O
it O
took O
you O
so O
long O
to O
get O
a O
reservation U-NEU
. O

The O
not O
- O
so O
- O
friendly O
- O
cigarette O
- O
reeking O
waiter U-NEG
asked O
if O
we O
had O
any O
questions O
then O
when O
we O
did O
ask O
, O
he O
rolled O
his O
eyes O
and O
covered O
his O
face O
with O
the O
menu U-NEU
to O
say O
something O
to O
a O
passing O
coworker O
. O

The O
staff O
beginning O
with O
the O
tall O
gentleman U-NEG
at O
the O
door U-NEU
, O
waiters O
, O
etc O
. O

No O
one O
bothered O
to O
ask O
if O
we O
were O
enjoying O
our O
food U-POS
or O
whether O
or O
not O
we O
wanted O
more O
to O
drink U-NEU
( O
we O
apparently O
needed O
to O
be O
out O
by O
8) O
. O

The O
kitchen B-NEU
nails I-NEU
pasta I-NEU
dishes L-NEU
, O
including O
spicy O
linguine B-POS
with I-POS
clams L-POS
and O
pancetta O
and O
perfect O
gnocchi U-POS
. O

The O
food U-NEG
took O
forever O
to O
come O
out O
from O
the O
kitchen U-NEU
. O

Though O
the O
service U-NEG
might O
be O
a O
little O
slow O
, O
the O
waitresses U-POS
are O
very O
friendly O
. O

Went O
to O
Butter O
on O
Monday O
night O
for O
a O
friend O
's O
birthday O
dinner U-NEU
at O
like O
11:00pm O
, O
the O
kitchen U-NEU
was O
supposedly O
closed O
, O
but O
we O
spoke O
to O
the O
manager U-POS
and O
we O
were O
seated O
promptly O
. O

Favorites O
include O
the O
Curry B-POS
Shrimp I-POS
w/ I-POS
Mushrooms L-POS
, O
Watercress B-POS
Salad L-POS
( O
not O
listed O
on O
menu U-NEU
) O
, O
and O
Kao O
Soy B-POS
noodle I-POS
soup I-POS
with I-POS
chicken L-POS
. O

I O
would O
n't O
go O
for O
dinner U-NEU
though O
cause O
it O
gets O
too O
crowded O
and O
the O
takeout U-NEG
at O
night O
is O
very O
slow O
. O

My O
complaint O
was O
with O
the O
service-- O
our O
waitress U-NEG
was O
rather O
pushy O
and O
visibly O
annoyed O
when O
we O
did O
n't O
order O
appetizers U-NEU
or O
dessert U-NEU
. O

I O
have O
definately O
found O
my O
new O
favorite O
place U-POS
for O
dinner U-NEU
and O
with O
its O
large O
bar U-POS
for O
hanging O
out O
on O
the O
weekends O
. O

The O
Maryland B-POS
Crabcake I-POS
roll L-POS
is O
good O
too O
if O
you O
are O
not O
into O
raw O
fish U-NEU
. O

Despite O
talking O
to O
the O
weekday O
manager U-NEG
on O
the O
prior O
Monday O
, O
who O
gave O
me O
a O
hard O
time O
but O
agreed O
to O
make O
a O
reservation U-NEU
for O
me O
since O
my O
group O
was O
so O
big O
. O

There O
's O
also O
a O
weekend O
brunch U-NEU
, O
big O
on B-POS
poached I-POS
eggs L-POS
, O
omelets U-NEU
and O
bagels U-NEU
and O
lox O
, O
plus O
fresh O
- O
squeezed O
OJ U-POS
. O

When O
they O
brought O
out O
the O
food U-NEU
the O
waiter U-NEG
dropped O
one O
of O
the O
plates O
right O
in O
front O
of O
us O
and O
did O
n't O
appologize O
or O
bring O
us O
out O
a O
complimentry O
plate O
. O

Our O
waitress U-NEG
' O
visits O
to O
our O
table U-NEU
were O
few O
and O
far O
between O
. O

I O
write O
that O
in O
quotes O
becuase O
iceberg B-NEU
lettuce L-NEU
, O
stale O
Pepperidge O
Farm O
croutons O
and O
bottled B-NEG
dressing L-NEG
does O
not O
a O
salad O
make O
. O

The O
pork U-POS
was O
good O
but O
3 O
small O
medalians O
and O
2 O
tablespoons O
of O
mashed O
potatos O
does O
not O
make O
a O
meal U-NEU
. O

The O
food U-POS
and O
wine B-POS
selection L-POS
is O
superb O
and O
the O
chef U-NEU
brings O
it O
all O
together O
each O
and O
every O
time O
. O

The O
place U-NEU
is O
full O
of O
flavor U-POS
and O
color O
and O
the O
music U-POS
just O
puts O
you O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
food U-POS
and O
drinks U-NEU
. O

I O
went O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
on O
the O
recommendation O
of O
the O
new B-POS
General I-POS
Manager L-POS
, O
Mike O
who O
also O
did O
Cheetah O
Club U-NEU
and O
Le O
Souk O
. O

The O
food U-NEU
will O
eventually O
make O
you O
outweigh O
Anna O
Nicole O
Smith U-NEG
. O

A O
huge O
water O
wall O
, O
pieced O
together O
with O
thousands O
of O
azure O
blue B-POS
tiles L-POS
dotted O
with O
white O
plaster U-NEU
body O
forms O
in O
mid O
- O
swan O
dive O
, O
rises O
up O
from O
the O
foyer O
to O
the O
second O
floor O
. O

Come O
to O
people O
watch O
and O
drink U-NEU
, O
but O
stay O
away O
from O
the O
food U-NEG
and O
service U-NEG
. O

When O
the O
manager U-NEG
was O
asked O
for O
things O
did O
imporve O
but O
2 O
hours O
to O
get O
our O
meal U-NEU
. O

Music U-NEG
was O
blasting O
( O
speakers O
located O
practically O
on O
top O
of O
every O
table O
) O
, O
and O
we O
asked O
the O
waitress U-NEU
if O
they O
can O
turn O
it O
down O
. O

The O
Scene U-POS
Though O
plenty O
of O
white O
- O
washed O
tables U-POS
and O
chairs U-NEU
are O
scattered O
about O
the O
dining B-NEU
room L-NEU
, O
it O
's O
the O
bar U-NEU
that O
acts O
as O
a O
neighborhood O
gathering O
place O
. O

The O
service U-NEG
was O
only O
average O
- O
even O
with O
reservations U-NEU
we O
waited O
40 O
minutes O
, O
and O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
our O
table U-NEU
, O
which O
had O
been O
ready O
, O
the O
hostess U-NEG
just O
never O
bothered O
to O
tell O
us O
. O

Good O
place U-POS
for O
groups O
of O
four O
or O
large O
parties O
but O
it O
is O
not O
a O
cozy O
/ O
intimate O
setting U-NEG
for O
2 O
although O
the O
jazz O
helps O
! O

Interior U-NEG
is O
limited O
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
second O
floor O
for O
dining U-NEU
to O
avoid O
some O
of O
the O
main O
floor O
chatter O
. O

Definitely O
make O
reservations U-NEU
if O
you O
can O
-- O
they O
'll O
honor O
them O
, O
and O
you O
can O
skip O
the O
massive O
wait U-NEG
! O

In O
edition O
, O
they O
have O
pasta U-NEU
and O
other O
entree U-NEU
choices O
along O
with O
an O
excellent O
quick O
breakfast U-POS
( O
omlet O
and O
homefries O
ext O
) O
. O

The O
only O
reason O
they O
seem O
to O
taste O
so O
good O
is O
because O
the O
food U-POS
is O
well O
decorated O
with O
its O
super O
small O
portion U-NEG
. O

Do O
n't O
they O
teach O
their O
staff U-NEG
how O
to O
pour O
water B-NEU
or I-NEU
wine L-NEU
? O

worth O
every O
penny U-POS
, O
and O
with O
the O
deals U-NEU
on O
the O
bar U-NEU
, O
you O
could O
drink U-NEU
and O
sing O
to O
CURRYoke O
all O
night O
, O
, O
, O
, O

We O
were O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
late O
for O
our O
reservation U-NEU
and O
minus O
one O
guest O
, O
but O
we O
did O
n't O
think O
we O
deserved O
the O
attitude O
we O
got O
from O
the O
hostess U-NEG
. O

The O
menu U-NEU
features O
American B-NEU
bistro I-NEU
dishes L-NEU
like O
crab B-NEU
cakes L-NEU
, O
chicken U-NEU
under O
a O
brick O
, O
fresh O
oysters O
and O
various O
seafood B-POS
dishes L-POS
. O

It O
's O
a O
good O
place O
to O
meet O
up O
with O
a O
friend O
while O
shopping O
, O
grab O
lunch O
( O
although O
the O
lines U-NEG
do O
get O
long O
) O
, O
dining U-NEU
solo O
, O
or O
to O
take O
home O
after O
work O
. O

I O
got O
a O
coke O
and O
dessert U-NEU
( O
fluffy O
, O
light O
tiramisu U-POS
) O
as O
well O
. O

Went O
there O
for O
a O
dinner U-NEU
; O
nice O
little O
place U-POS
. O

my O
waitress U-NEG
was O
unable O
to O
answer O
my O
questions O
about O
the O
menu U-NEU
, O
and O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
my O
order O
. O

The O
noise U-NEG
level O
is O
equivalent O
to O
a O
sports O
bar U-NEU
. O

To O
sum O
it O
up O
, O
the O
steak U-POS
is O
indeed O
the O
best O
out O
there O
, O
but O
the O
servers U-NEG
and O
especially O
the O
hosts U-NEG
are O
big O
time O
jerks O
. O

This O
Prospect O
Heights O
institution O
, O
with O
its O
old O

fashioned O
soda B-NEG

fountain L-NEG
type O
counter O

complete O
with O

the O

on O
pedastals O
w O

, O
attracts O
a O
diverse O
and O
loyal O
crowd U-POS

Staples U-POS
are O
available O
every O
which O
way O
-- O
tacos U-NEU
hard O

soft O

wrapped O
in O

; O
plus O
a O
choice O
of O
four O
sauces U-NEU
from O
mild O
to O
just O
plain O
stupid U-NEU
. O

For O
appetizers U-NEU
, O
I O
'd O
recommend O
the O
soft B-POS
shell I-POS
crab L-POS
, O
spicy B-POS
New I-POS
Zealand I-POS
mussels L-POS
, O
calamari U-POS
and O
anything O
from O
the O
sushi B-POS
bar L-POS
. O

A O
cute O
restaurant O
and O
average O
food U-NEU
( O
with O
a O
small O
menu U-NEG
) O
. O

The O
staff U-POS
was O
accomodating O
towards O
our O
daughter O
and O
nice O
enough O
to O
check O
up O
on O
her O
after O
they O
served B-NEU
dinner L-NEU
( O
I O
was O
a O
little O
concerned O
about O
the O
spices U-NEU
and O
they O
suggested O
a O
dish O
) O
. O

Food U-POS
was O
good O
although O
menu U-NEG
was O
a O
little O
limited(still O
plenty O
to O
chose O
from O
) O
. O

The O
manager U-NEG
then O
comes O
over O
to O
the O
table O
and O
asks O
us O
to O
leave O
- O
to O
help O
him O
out O
because O
there O
were O
people O
waiting U-NEU
! O

The O
service U-POS
was O
good O
enough O
for O
a O
crowded O
place U-NEG
. O

So O
we O
left O
, O
the O
menu U-POS
looked O
decent O
but O
you O
have O
to O
go O
when O
you O
can O
get O
one O
of O
the O
2 O
or O
3 O
tables U-NEU
. O

Do O
n't O
forget O
to O
order O
a O
raspberry B-POS
lemonade L-POS
or O
your O
brunch U-NEU
will O
not O
be O
complete O
! O

The O
guacamole U-NEU
at O
$ O
7 O
is O
a O
small O
portion U-NEG
served O
with O
a O
stack O
of O
Si!Ortega O
flat O
taco O
shells U-NEU
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
a O
late O
dinner U-NEU
last O
night O
with O
a O
friend O
and O
the O
service U-NEG
was O
aweful O
. O

As O
for O
their O
pasta U-NEU
, O
the B-NEG
tomato I-NEG
sauce L-NEG
, O
not O
the O
tomato O
basil O
; O
it O
's O
got O
a O
tang O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
. O

There O
were O
sesame U-NEU
seeds O
on O
the O
outside O
( O
it O
's O
pizza O
dough O
not O
a O
hamburger B-NEG
bun L-NEG
) O
, O
barely O
any O
sauce O
, O
VERY O
thin O
slices O
of O
mozzarella O
sparingly O
applied O
and O
topped O
with O
lots O
of O
herbs O
. O

you O
might O
have O
made O
a O
reservation U-NEU
, O
but O
you O
will O
end O
up O
waiting U-NEG
for O
about O
an O
hour O
anyway O
, O
so O
hopefully O
you O
'll O
get O
a O
seat U-NEG
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
and O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
stand O
around O
. O

Then O
the O
waitress U-NEG
became O
upset O
when O
she O
returned O
with O
the O
drinks U-NEU
and O
we O
did O
n't O
stop O
our O
conversations O
quick O
enough O
to O
remind O
her O
who O
had O
ordered O
what O
only O
5 O
minutes O
prior O
. O

Sit O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
and O
eat O
here O
regularly O
and O
the O
sushi B-POS
chef L-POS
who O
is O
also O
the O
owner U-POS
will O
hook O
you O
up O
the O
best O
cuts O
of O
fish U-POS
. O

maybe O
we O
ordered O
the O
wrong O
items O
because O
the O
food U-NEG
was O
not O
spectacular O
, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
the O
poppy O
- O
seeded O
sweet O
beet B-POS
ravioli I-POS
appetizer L-POS
. O

I O
'm O
from O
Italy O
and O
i O
felt O
home O
great O
and O
fresh O
food O
, O
good O
pizza U-POS
, O
i O
been O
there O
few O
times O
and O
i O
always O
go O
with O
the O
special U-NEU
or O
seafood U-NEU
, O
about O
dessert U-NEU
try O
the O
profitterol O
. O

We O
poked O
our O
heads O
in O
for O
a O
few O
bottles O
of O
wine O
, O
some O
good O
hot B-POS
onion I-POS
soup L-POS
and O
a O
few O
hot B-NEU
appetizers L-NEU
to O
warm O
us O
up O
after O
a O
seeing O
a O
show O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
they O
do O
have O
a O
nice O
lounge B-POS
area L-POS
downstairs O
where O
you O
can O
just O
hang O
out O
, O
have O
a O
seat O
, O
and O
relax O
( O
no O
more O
waiting U-NEG
out O
in O
the O
cold O
or O
at O
the O
crowded O
bar U-NEG
) O
. O

The O
Food U-NEU
Most O
restaurants O
with O
more O
than O
250 O
items O
on O
the O
regular B-NEG
menu L-NEG
do O
n't O
do O
any O
of O
them O
particularly O
well O
. O

Patrons O
can O
choose O
to O
be O
seated O
in O
the O
front O
room O
with O
a O
little O
more O
activity O
and O
more O
of O
a O
bar U-NEU
feel O
or O
in O
one O
of O
the O
2 O
back B-NEU
rooms L-NEU
which O
both O
offer O
slightly O
quieter O
, O
more O
relaxed O
environments U-POS
. O

When O
you O
go O
, O
you O
should O
ask O
for O
help O
from O
the O
wait B-NEU
staff L-NEU
in O
deciding O
what O
to O
order O
since O
the O
menu U-NEG
can O
be O
daunting O
. O

The O
whole B-POS
fish L-POS
was O
excellent O
-- O
not O
overcooked O
and O
served U-NEU
in O
a O
light B-NEU
tomato I-NEU
broth L-NEU
. O

I O
love O
the O
decor U-POS
but O
would O
not O
recommend O
sitting O
in O
the O
communal O
tables O
unless O
its O
a O
very O
big O
group O
, O
much O
more O
fun O
getting O
a O
table O
and O
people O
watch O
while O
you O
chomp O
on O
your O
$ O
20 O
palm O
sized B-NEU
truffle I-NEU
pizza L-NEU
. O

I O
prefer O
to O
sit O
in O
the O
lounge O
area O
or O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
, O
as O
the O
service U-POS
is O
quicker O
and O
the O
space U-POS
is O
more O
attractive O
. O

I O
went O
back O
to O
telly O
's O
because O
i O
heard O
that O
they O
changed O
the O
Chef U-NEU
and O
the O
food U-POS
was O
again O
, O
after O
a O
very O
very O
small O
break O
, O
was O
excellent O
again O
. O

It O
's O
really O
great O
to O
go O
in O
here O
and O
be O
able O
to O
get O
a O
creative O
cheap O
drink U-POS
( O
they O
have O
things O
like O
blueberry B-NEU
mohitos L-NEU
for O
$ O
4 O
) O
, O
a O
$ O
4 O
plate O
of O
veggie B-NEU
spring I-NEU
rolls L-NEU
, O
and O
be O
able O
to O
joke O
with O
the O
bartender U-NEU
. O

Tension U-NEG
filled O
the O
air U-NEU
as O
the O
chief O
yelled O
at O
a O
waiter U-NEU
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
bar U-NEU
while O
in O
uniform O
and O
drinking O
. O

For O
dessert U-NEU
, O
the O
oversized B-POS
bread I-POS

ca O
n't O
be O
beat O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
much O
to O
say O
about O
the O
cafe O
itself O
; O
you O
can O
order O
out O
from O
the O
family O
- O
run O
cafe O
in O
the O
front O
, O
or O
take O
a O
seat U-NEG
in O
the O
back O
, O
which O
opens O
up O
to O
the O
outdoors O
and O
can O
offer O
a O
less O
seedy O
and O
more O
homey O
atmosphere U-POS
. O

from O
the O
sandwich B-NEU
wraps L-NEU
and O
hot O
italian B-POS
dishes L-POS
to O
the O
creative O

The O

there O
are O
plenty O
of O

95 O
all O
- O
you O
- O
can O
- O
eat O
lunch O
is O
tooted O
as O
a O
good O
deal O
but O
a O
the O
ambiance O
is O
dreadful O
and O
you O
can O
get O
a O
terrific O
meal U-POS
, O
also O
kosher O
vegetarian U-NEU
, O
in O
peace O
with O
service U-NEU
just O
around O
the O
corner O
for O
$ O
2 O
more O
. O

Good O
atmosphere U-POS
, O
the O
service O
is O
so O
- O
so O
and O
there O
is O
a O
long O
wait U-NEG
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
reservations O
. O

Even O
a O
modest O
bottle B-NEU
of I-NEU
wine L-NEU
was O
accurately O
described O
by O
the O
wait B-POS
staff L-POS
and O
pleasing O
. O

I O
definitely O
liked O
the O
vibe U-NEU
in O
the O
restaurant O
- O
the O
food U-POS
is O
good O
with O
enough O
variety O
to O
please O
everyone O
- O
i O
'd O
say O
the O
portions U-NEG
were O
quite O
skimpy O
where O
it O
counts O
- O
meat O
whether O
fish U-NEU
or O
steak- O
and O
for O
those O
prices O
this O
is O
very O
irksome O
. O

went O
there O
for O
dinner U-NEU
over O
the O
weekend O
and O
was O
treated O
rudely O
right O
away O
by O
what O
I O
think O
was O
a O
manager U-NEG
who O
was O
doing O
anything O
but O
managing O
. O

Come O
- O
as O
- O
you O
- O
are O
atmosphere U-POS
, O
jukebox U-NEU
, O
value U-NEU
and O
James O
behind O
the O
bar U-NEU
work O
as O
a O
magnet O
. O

Our O
waiter U-NEG
never O
once O
came O
by O
the O
table U-NEU
to O
ask O
us O
how O
our O
meal O
was O
. O

My O
dinner U-NEU
partner O
ordered O
the O
angel O
hair U-NEU
with O
seafood O
- O
the O
portion U-POS
was O
easily O
big O
enough O
for O
two O
. O

After O
waiting U-NEU
almost O
an O
hour O
for O
a O
table O
( O
with O
resies O
) O
our O
waiter U-NEG
told O
us O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
sommelier O
because O
no O
steakhouse O
has O
a O
sommelier O
( O
patently O
false O
) O
, O
and O
finished O
with O
the O
notion O
that O
he O
had O
absolutely O
no O
idea O
about O
any O
of O
the O
wines U-NEU
on O
the O
list O
. O

Great O
food U-POS
as O
usual O
, O
the O
paella U-NEU
valenciana O
our O
fave O
and O
oooh O
those O
coconut B-NEU
mojitos L-NEU
ahh O
! O

waitstaff U-NEG
was O
more O
into O
pushing O
the O
sparkling O
water U-NEU
than O
give O
me O
a O
wine B-NEU
menu L-NEU
. O

There O
was O
a O
nice O
atmosphere U-POS
except O
for O
the O
few O
pompous O
patrons O
who O
looked O
way O
too O
gaudy O
or O
a O
lunch U-NEU
time O
meal U-NEU
, O
but O
overall O
its O
a O
great O
place O
to O
eat O
. O

The O
place U-POS
is O
huge O
, O
but O
it O
's O
always O
packed O
with O
people O
waiting O
to O
be O
seated O
because O
they O
made O
the O
mistake O
of O
not O
making O
a O
reservation U-NEU
! O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
the O
waiter U-NEG
a O
couple O
of O
times O
to O
clear O
our O
empty O
glasses U-NEU
. O

The O
place U-NEG
was O
empty O
( O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
were O
the O
only O
one O
's O
there O
other O
than O
the O
potty O
- O
mouthed O
patron O
's O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
) O
yet O
the O
service U-NEG
was O
slow O
. O

It O
looks O
like O
a O
dive O
but O
serves O
up O
fresh O
authentic O
Mexican B-POS
fare L-POS
you O
wo O
n't O
normally O
find O
in O
your O
average O
Tex O
- O
Mex O
style O
restaraunt U-NEG
. O

THE O
SERVICE- O
we O
had O
a O
reservation U-NEU
, O
they O
took O
forever O
to O
seat U-NEG
us O
and O
when O
they O
did O
we O
did O
n't O
see O
a O
waiter U-NEG
for O
about O
15 O
minutes O
and O
he O
acted O
as O
if O
we O
were O
at O
some O
drive O
thru O
, O
rushing O
us O
and O
then O
ignoring O
our O
table O
( O
actually O
we O
hardly O
saw O
him O
at O
all O
) O
throughout O
the O
night U-NEU
. O

) O
Howver O
, O
we O
did O
n't O
expect O
to O
be O
bumped O
by O
waiters U-NEG
a O
few O
times O
during O
our O
dinner U-NEU
. O

The O
momos B-POS
( I-POS
dumplings I-POS
) L-POS
are O
tiny O
with O
paper O
- O
thin O
dough U-POS
, O
the O
shitake B-POS
pancakes L-POS
are O
to O
die O
for O
, O
the O
steamed B-POS
greens L-POS
( O
I O
forgot O
the O
name O
of O
the O
dish U-NEU
) O
is O
delicious O
as O
a O
vegetarian O
entry O
or O
with O
sauteed O
salmon U-POS
. O

The O
food U-POS
is O
undeniably O
good O
-- O
but O
not O
worth O
the O
wait U-NEG
. O

Had O
an O
after O
- O
work O
drink U-NEU
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
with O
a O
date O
, O
loved O
the O
place U-POS
so O
much O
we O
came O
back O
for O
brunch U-NEU
the O
next O
morning O
. O

You O
have O
to O
be O
comfortable O
eating O
with O
your O
hands O
, O
sharing O
the O
same O
plate U-NEU
with O
your O
friends O
and O
be O
able O
to O
handle O
spicy O
food O
( O
not O
as O
spicy O
as O
some O
thai B-POS
dishes L-POS
though O
) O
. O

Last O
night O
was O
our O
second O
time O
dining U-NEU
here O
and O
we O
are O
still O
amazed O
with O
the O
food U-POS
. O

The O
cod U-POS
was O
very O
good O
but O
a O
bit O
soupy O
in O
vegetable B-NEG
juices L-NEG
. O

It O
's O
not O
going O
to O
win O
any O
awards O
for O
its O
decor U-NEG
, O
but O
the O
food U-POS
is O
good O
, O
the O
portions U-POS
are O
big O
, O
and O
the O
prices U-POS
are O
low O
. O

Later O
, O
as O
our O
large O
party O
began O
filtering O
out O
, O
I O
overheard O
our O
waiter O
discussing O
the O
menu U-NEU
mixup O
to O
about O
5 O
members O
of O
the O
staff U-NEG
, O
blaming O
us O
. O

Atmosphere U-NEG
, O
I O
'd O
give O
to O
Rosa O
or O
Maya O
, O
but O
Mexican B-POS
fare L-POS
at O
Zarela O
is O
tops O
. O

The O
manager U-NEG
never O
came O
to O
our O
table O
and O
the O
restaurant O
did O
n't O
offer O
anything O
to O
compensate O
for O
the O
error O
( O
they O
could O
have O
taken O
the O
two O
cocktails U-NEU
off O
the O
check O
) O
. O

I O
've O
heard O
all O
the O
complaints O
about O
food U-NEG
and O
staff U-NEG
at O
this O
place U-NEU
, O
and O
perhaps O
some O
people O
have O
had O
an O
unfortunate O
encounter O
with O
the O
host O
or O
a O
cranky O
waiter U-NEG
. O

for O
the O
prices U-NEG
that O
are O
on O
the O
regular O
menu U-NEU
we O
were O
expecting O
something O
more O
upscale O
and O
less O
generic O
. O

Ok O
the O
manager U-NEG
did O
stand O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
the O
whole O
time O
looking O
like O
his O
wife O
left O
him O
, O
he O
lost O
all O
his O
money O
at O
the O
track O
and O
had O
been O
drinking O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
day O
. O

The O
waitress U-NEU
recommended O
four O
courses U-NEU
, O
not O
three O
, O
given O
their O
tiny O
size U-NEG
. O

We O
were O
the O
only O
two O
people O
sitting O
out O
front O
and O
the O
waiter O
was O
unable O
to O
provide O
us O
with O
attentive O
service U-POS
OR O
our O
dinner U-NEU
. O

no O
need O
for O
reservation U-NEU
) O
you O
'd O
expect O
the O
crew U-NEG
to O
be O
alittle O
more O
attentive O
. O

While O
I O
love O
this O
place U-POS
, O
I O
do O
recommend O
going O
here O
mostly O
for O
lunch U-NEU
or O
an O
early O
dinner U-NEU
because O
the O
crowd O
and O
long O
wait U-NEG
can O
be O
annoying O
. O

Service U-POS
was O
n't O
great O
- O
they O
accidentally O
gave O
us O
our O
neighbors O
' O
entrees O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
good O
40-minute O
wait O
between O
appetizers O
and O
main B-NEU
courses L-NEU
- O
but O
the O
food U-POS
was O
overall O
very O
good O
, O
particularly O
the O
desserts U-POS
. O

The O
Scene U-NEU
Strictly O
Roots O
, O
which O
opened O
more O
than O
a O
decade O
ago O
as O
a O
dietary O
alternative O
to O
Harlem O
's O
more O
cholesterol- O
and O
fat O
- O
heavy O
fare U-NEG
, O
wears O
its O
philosophy O
on O
its O
facade O
: O
We O
serve O
nothing O
that O
crawls O
, O
walks O
, O
swims O
or O
flies O
. O

The O
presentation U-POS
was O
clever O
, O
and O
the O
food U-POS
tasty O
however O
the O
service U-NEG
that O
accompanied O
it O
was O
so O
slow O
it O
made O
us O
feel O
neglected O
. O

The O
menu B-NEG
prices L-NEG
are O
a O
bit O
expensive O
for O
what O
you O
get O
in O
quality U-NEU
and O
portion B-NEU
size L-NEU
. O

Mom O
's O
cooking U-POS
without O
the O
meat U-NEU
, O
the O
not O
- O
terribly O
- O
diverse O
but O
tempting O
nonetheless O
dinner B-POS
menu L-POS
is O
both O
filling O
and O
comforting O
, O
and O
the O
modest O
outer O
- O
boroughs O
price B-POS
tag L-POS
makes O
this O
place O
a O
definite O
return O
visit O
, O
particularly O
since O
it O
's O
only O
one O
train O
stop O
outside O
the O
city O
. O

Food U-POS
is O
okay O
for O
the O
price U-NEU
, O
however O
there O
is O
definitely O
better O
thai O
restaurants O
! O
! O

In O
Short O
Though O
it O
's O
more O
of O
a O
takeout O
and O
delivery U-NEU
operation O
than O
a O
sit O
- O
down O
restaurant O
, O
Risotteria O
does O
offer O
eight O
small O
tables U-NEG
for O
those O
who O
want O
to O
savor O
their O
risotto U-POS
hot O
off O
the O
stove O
. O

The O
manager U-NEG
came O
out O
very O
defensively O
and O
insisted O
that O
it O
was O
a O
2 O
lb O
lobster U-NEU
. O

The O
waiters U-NEG
were O
rude O
, O
and O
the O
appetizer U-NEU
dip O
had O
bits O
of O
bread U-NEU
in O
it O
from O
someone O
else O
's O
dinner O
. O

Marisol O
at O
the O
front O
desk O
is O
serviceable O
; O
our O
sommelier U-NEU
, O
though O
not O
French O
, O
knew O
his O
Bordeaux O
, O
and O
our O
server U-POS
was O
delightful O
. O

After O
dinner U-NEU
we O
ordered O
a O
hookah O
and O
after O
20 O
minutes O
waitress U-NEG
comes O
by O
and O
tried O
to O
take O
it O
away O
because O
she O
claims O
our O
table O
is O
reserve O
for O
another O
group O
in O
10 O
minute O
. O

Other O
than O
making O
the O
grill O
flame O
at O
the O
beginning O
our O
hibatchi O
chef U-NEG
did O
nt O
put O
on O
much O
of O
a O
show O
- O
no O
flipping O
stuff O
into O
is O
hat O
or O
our O
plates U-NEU
- O
so O
if O
that O
is O
your O
thing O
go O
to O
Benihani O
. O

The O
scene U-POS
is O
pretty O
cool O
and O
the O
drinks U-POS
are O
OK O
, O
but O
the O
food O
and O
service U-NEG
were O
pretty O
weak O
. O

Once O
the O
food U-NEU
came O
, O
we O
could O
not O
eat O
because O
we O
did O
not O
have O
the O
little O
plates U-NEU
