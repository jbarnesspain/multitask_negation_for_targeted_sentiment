The O
food U-NEU
was O
served U-POS
promptly O
but O
the O
meal O
was O
n't O
rushed O
- O
we O
had O
plenty O
of O
time O
to O
enjoy O
the O
appetizers U-POS
and O
our O
entrees O
as O
well O
as O
sit O
and O
chat O
while O
finishing O
up O
our O
drinks O
even O
after O
we O
paid O
. O

When O
I O
got O
home O
, O
there O
was O
a O
message O
on O
the O
machine O
because O
the O
owner U-NEU
realized O
that O
our O
waitress U-NEG
forgot O
to O
charge O
us O
for O
our O
wine U-NEU
. O

The O
Scene U-POS
Shun O
Lee O
Palace O
is O
popular O
with O
midtown O
locals O
, O
possibly O
because O
the O
upscale O
room O
means O
you O
can O
impress O
a O
client O
and O
have O
Chinese O
for O
lunch U-NEU
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

To O
both O
our O
surprise O
, O
this O
inquiry O
was O
interpreted O
as O
a O
personal O
offense O
by O
the O
waiter U-NEG
who O
told O
my O
wife O
to O
leave O
the O
store O
if O
she O
did O
nt O
want O
the O
pastries U-NEU
. O

In O
fact O
you O
can O
find O
their O
menu U-NEU
offerings O
at O
other O
places O
for O
better O
qualities O
and O
lower O
prices U-POS
. O

Been O
here O
a O
few O
times O
and O
food U-POS
has O
always O
been O
good O
but O
service U-NEG
really O
suffers O
when O
it O
gets O
crowded O
. O

It O
's O
sad O
that O
everything O
about O
this O
place O
was O
great O
( O
even O
the O
service U-POS
and O
decor U-POS
) O
except O
for O
the O
steak U-NEG
. O

to O
be O
honest O
we O
only O
had O
drinks O
and O
appetizers U-NEU
downstairs O
as O
we O
were O
there O
for O
a O
collegues O
leaving O
drinks O
but O
the O
staff U-POS
was O
very O
friendly O
( O
typical O
aussies O
) O
and O
the O
food U-POS
i O
did O
have O
was O
pretty O
darn O
good O
. O

The O
brasserie B-NEU

various O

sandwiches O
. O

we O
all O
liked O
the O
brunch U-POS
items O
we O
had O
but O
when O
we O
later O
asked O
if O
the O
chips U-NEU
were O
supposed O
to O
come O
with O
the O
meal O
, O
the O
waitress U-NEG
explained O
it O
away O
by O
saying O
sometimes O
they O
forget O
instead O
of O
apologizing O
and O
offering O
something O
extra O
. O

Appetizers U-POS
are O
the O
safest O
bet O
, O
including O
a O
bountiful B-NEU
calamari I-NEU
plate L-NEU
or O
the O
appropriately B-NEU
earthy I-NEU

I O
ve O

at O
the O

in O
my O

The O
Scene U-NEU
Hunky O
waiters U-NEG
dub O
diners U-NEU
darling U-NEU
and O
it O
sounds O
like O
they O
mean O
it O
. O

Instead O
, O
4 O
members O
of O
the O
wait B-NEG
staff L-NEG
were O
giggling O
and O
carrying O
on O
at O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
bar U-NEU
. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
20 O
minutes O
before O
getting O
a O
beer U-NEU
, O
and O
we O
never O
got O
our O
burger O
order U-NEG
. O

The O
waitress U-NEG
forgot O
our O
coffee U-NEU
, O
took O
forever O
to O
take O
our O
order O
, O
never O
checked O
in O
with O
us O
after O
the O
food U-NEU
came O
and O
when O
we O
were O
done O
, O
did O
n't O
bring O
us O
the O
check O
for O
the O
longest O
time O
. O

We O
had O
no O
problems O
with O
our O
resevations O
and O
found O
the O
service U-NEU
and O
the O
meal U-NEU
well O
worth O
a O
wait U-POS
, O
had O
we O
run O
into O
one O
. O

One O
of O
our O
diners O
did O
n't O
like O
her O
fish U-NEG
and O
both O
the O
waitress U-NEU
and O
the O
manager U-NEU
insisted O
on O
replacing O
it O
. O

A O
glass B-POS
of I-POS
wine L-POS
for O
each O
of O
us O
( O
decent O

individual B-NEU
pizzas L-NEU
( O
just O
ok O
, O
and O
really O

less O
filling O
than O
two O

, O
not O

nearly O

as O
good O
as O
John O

, O
a O
shared O
dessert U-POS
( O
good O
but O
rather O
small O
) O
, O
and O
the O

On O
the O
menu U-NEU
, O
there O
are O
many O
inexpensive O
snacks O
, O
drinks O
and O
meals U-POS
to O
choose O
from O

My O
dining U-NEU
companion O
and O
I O
have O
nothing O
but O
raves O
about O
the O
environment U-POS
and O
the O
Food U-POS
. O

While O
waiting U-NEU
for O
a O
table U-NEU
, O
tried O
to O
get O
a O
drink U-NEU
from O
a O
bartender O
who O
seemed O
more O
interested O
in O
arguing O
with O
his O
waiters U-NEG
. O

There O
should O
be O
more O
choices O
of O
items O
to O
load O
on O
the O
pie U-NEU
, O
still O
quality O
of O
their O
classic O
pizza U-POS
is O
a O
slice O
above O
. O

The O
meat U-POS
, O
onions O
, O
and O
cheese U-POS
were O
good O
as O
was O
the O
roll O
, O
but O
I O
'd O
go O
back O
if O
I O
could O
forego O
the O
sauce U-NEU
. O

Rich O
appetizers U-POS
( O
baked B-NEU
fontina L-NEU

lentil B-NEU

, O
french B-NEU
onion I-NEU

and O
ample O

tasty O

Went O
here O
with O
my O
husband O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
for O
dinner U-NEU
since O
the O
place U-NEU
looked O
like O
it O
had O
great O
atmosphere U-POS
. O

The O
bartender U-POS
, O
the O
wait B-POS
staff L-POS
and O
management O
all O
put O
the O
customer U-NEU
first O
and O
that O
was O
clear O
and O
much O
appreciated U-POS
. O

I O
find O
the O
attitude U-POS
of O
the O
managers U-POS
to O
be O
appallingly O
superior O
, O
and O
the O
food U-NEG
below O
average O
, O
at O
sky O
- O
high O
prices O
. O

I O
recently O
ate O
Brunch U-NEU
there O
and O
was O
dismayed O
and O
dissapointed O
by O
the O
service U-NEG
. O

) O
The O
food U-POS
was O
good O
, O
but O
not O
at O
all O
worth O
the O
price U-NEG
. O

He O
described O
the O
specials U-POS
in O
great O
detail O
and O
gave O
wine U-NEU
and O
appertizer O
suggestions O
. O

The O
portions U-NEG
were O
kid O
sized O
and O
we O
spent O
about O
$ O
100 O
a O
person O
in O
cluding B-NEU
wine L-NEU
( O
4 O
of O
us O
) O
. O

My O
only O
quibbles O
are O
service U-NEG
- O
which O
was O
confused O
( O
we O
waited O
10 O
minutes O
for O
menus U-NEU
) O
, O
and O
the O
wine B-NEG
list L-NEG
, O
which O
is O
over O
- O
the O
- O
top O
expensive O
. O

The O
waiter U-POS
made O
a O
huge O
production O
over O
what O
order O
he O
should O
deliver O
the O
food O
, O
as O
we O
all O
agreed O
the O
miso O
should O
be O
eaten O
with O
the O
sushi U-NEU
to O
aid O
digestion O
. O

The O
kitchen O
turns O
out O
a O
long O
list U-POS
of O
American B-NEU
bar I-NEU
food I-NEU
staples L-NEU
, O
like O
burgers U-NEU
and O
fries U-NEU
. O

When O
we O
went O
to O
dinner U-NEU
here O
, O
the O
place U-NEG
was O
empty O
, O
which O
should O
have O
been O
a O
clue O
. O

Went O
to O
celebrate O
my O
sisters O
birthday O
on O
9/11 O
was O
1st O
taken O
back O
on O
the O
waiters U-NEG
rude O
answering O
of O
a O
question O
we O
had O
about O
the O
menu U-NEU
. O

The O
food U-POS
is O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
after O
2 O
or O
3 O
bad O
experiences O
at O
the O
restaurant O
( O
consistently O
rude O
, O
late O
with O
RSVP'd O
seating U-NEU
) O
, O
I O
decided O
I O
would O
only O
order O
delivery U-NEU
. O

The O
backyard U-NEU
provides O
a O
relaxing O
alternative U-POS
, O
with O
wood O
- O
planked O
walls O
, O
climbing O
vines O
and O
umbrella O
- O
topped O
tables U-POS
. O

Bernard O
is O
a O
great O
host U-POS
; O
it O
did O
n't O
bother O
me O
a O
bit O
that O
he O
recited O
the O
entire O
menu U-NEU
to O
my O
wife O
. O

' O
When O
I O
called O
the O
waitress U-NEG
on O
it O
, O
she O
said O
that O
they O
simply O
could O
n't O
serve O
tap O
water U-NEU
. O

Telly O
's O
has O
the O
best O
octopus O
ever O
and O
the O
fish U-POS
was O
so O
good O
on O
the O
grill U-NEU
. O

Especially O
the O
manager U-NEG
or O
host U-NEG
who O
kept O
walking O
by O
and O
giving O
us O
the O
evil O
eye O
to O
see O
the O
progress O
of O
our O
dinner U-NEU
so O
they O
could O
turn O
the O
table O
over O
to O
other O
customers O
. O

the O
salad U-POS
was O
good O
but O
my O
friends O
hardly O
ate O
their O
pasta U-NEG
. O

The O
chicken B-NEU
breast I-NEU
with I-NEU
mole I-NEU
sauce L-NEU
, O
guacamole U-NEU
, O
sour B-POS
cream I-POS
and I-POS
pico I-POS
de L-POS
gallo O
is O
a O
delicious O
main O
course O
and O
quite O
filling O
. O

We O
went O
for O
Buffet B-NEU
lunch L-NEU
and O
the O
sauce U-NEG
was O
water O
down O
, O
not O
at O
all O
spicy O
. O

ran O
~$30 O
( O
$ O
12 O
for O
the O
taco O
, O
8 O
for O
the O
rb O
, O
10 O
fir O
the O
drink U-NEU
) O
plus O
tax O
and O
a O
very O
deserved O
tip U-POS
. O

Of O
course O
we O
went O
there O
with O
a O
large O
party O
and O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
bit O
to O
get O
seated O
( O
even O
with O
reservations U-NEU
) O
, O
but O
we O
had O
all O
our O
dishes B-POS
served L-POS
at O
the O
same O
time O
and O
promptly O
. O

We O
hunted O
the O
waitress U-NEG
to O
at O
least O
pay O
for O
the O
drinks U-NEU
. O

Otherwise O
, O
you O
can O
eat O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
( O
It O
was O
Saturday O
afternoon O
and O
the O
place U-NEG
was O
empty O
) O
. O

The O
not O
so O
goods O
: O
very O
pricey O
appetizers U-NEG
- O
$ O
12 O
for O
a O
half O
cup B-NEU
of I-NEU
fried I-NEU
clams L-NEU
, O
$ O

for O
two O
corn O
on O
the O
cob O
and O
$ O
6 O
for O
a O
small O
plate O
of O
fries O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
fried B-NEG
catfish L-NEG
, O
which O
had O
very O
little O
to O
no O
seasoning U-NEG
, O
the O
yams U-POS
, O
and O
mac B-POS
and I-POS
cheese L-POS
which O
were O
just O
okay O
. O

When O
the O
manager U-NEU
came O
to O
our O
table U-NEU
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
and O
asked O
how O
our O
experience O
was O
, O
I O
complained O
to O
him O
about O
the O
cold U-NEG
. O

The O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
of O
the O
night O
was O
the O
dessert U-POS
which O
was O
very O
good O
but O
certainly O
not O
worth O
the O
cost U-NEG
of O
an O
overall O
horible O
experience O
. O

The O
waiter U-POS
knew O
about O
every O
item O
on O
the O
menu U-NEU
and O
explained O
it O
very O
well O
. O

Our O
waiter U-POS
seemed O
to O
really O
care O
about O
getting O
us O
to O
the O
show O
on O
time O
, O
and O
made O
some O
good O
reccomendations O
on O
the O
menu U-NEU
for O
doing O
it O
. O

WAY O
OVER O
PRICED U-NEG
, O
HAD O
MUCH O
BETTER O
MEALS U-POS
FOR O
JUST O
OVER O
HALF O
THE O
PRICE O
IN O
PLACES O
JUST O
AS O
NICE O
. O

the O
peanut B-NEG
sauce L-NEG
came O
in O
a O
tiny O
plastic O
cup O
smaller O
than O
a O
shot O
glass U-NEU
. O

Ten O
minutes O
later O
the O
manager U-NEG
relented O
and O
dropped O
off O
a O
glass B-NEU
of I-NEU
water L-NEU
with O
an O
upturned O
nose O
. O

While O
the O
staff U-POS
was O
kind O
and O
attentive O
, O
our O
waiter U-POS
never O
once O
broke O
a O
smile O
, O
even O
when O
I O
told O
him O
it O
was O
my O
friend O
's O
birthday O
, O
although O
he O
did O
bring O
a O
dessert U-NEU
with O
a O

at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal U-NEU

a O
california B-NEU
roll L-NEU
, O
and O
a O
whole O
plate O
of O
food U-POS
. O

I O
planned O
a O
holiday B-NEU
dinner L-NEU
at O
Kurio O
and O
we O
ended O
up O
waiting U-NEG
two O
hours O
for O
the O
appetizers U-NEU
. O

The O
food U-POS
was O
barely O
decent O
and O
our O
server U-NEG
was O
nowhere O
to O
be O
found O
. O

They O
've O
also O
got O
a O

typically O
) O
, O
great O

was O
immediately O
told O
by O
our O
waiter U-NEG
that O
they O
were O
out O
of O
sparking O
mineral O
water U-NEU
. O

The O
third O
time O

bring O
it O
until O
15 O
minutes O
after O
we O
had O
received O
our O
brunch U-NEU
. O

In O
retrospect O
, O
that O
was O
kind O
of O
foolish O
, O
as O
the O
portions U-NEG
for O
dinner U-NEU
were O
obscene O
. O

The O
mango B-NEG
salsa I-NEG
with I-NEG
fish I-NEG
cake L-NEG
was O
too O
sour O
, O
the O
apple B-NEG
suace L-NEG
for O
pork B-NEU
chop L-NEU
too O
sweet O
. O

The O
service U-NEG
was O
rather O
slow O
but O
our O
waiter U-POS
was O
very O
pleasant O
and O
obliging O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
interacting O
with O
sour O
- O
puss O
employees U-NEU
, O
then O
by O
all O
means O
, O
enjoy O
the O
treats U-POS
at O
Sweet O
Melissa O
. O

But O
if O
you O
want O
cheap O
eggs U-POS
, O
omelets O
, O
pancakes U-NEU
or O
French B-NEU
Toast L-NEU
, O
with O
all O
the O
trimmings O
plus O
good O
coffee U-POS
, O
fast O
and O
straight O
- O
up O
, O
this O
is O
the O
place O
if O
you O
live O
in O
Park O
Slope O
. O

The O
open B-NEU
- I-NEU
faced I-NEU
sandwich L-NEU
I O
tried O
had O
fluffy O
scrambled B-POS
eggs L-POS
and O
the O
silkiest O
smoked O
salmon O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
, O
and O
I O
've O
eated O
a O
lot O
of O
lox U-NEU
over O
the O
years O
! O

While O
the O
service U-NEG
and O
setting U-NEG
were O
average O
, O
the O
food U-POS
was O
excellent O
. O

We O
were O
so O
excited O
since O
I O
was O
reading O
great O
review O
of O
this O
place U-NEG
, O
however O
we O
were O
disappointed O
with O
the O
taste U-NEU
of O
the O
food U-POS
. O

So O
we O
showed O
up O
with O
our O
reservations U-NEU
and O
even O
though O
the O
place U-NEG
stayed O
pretty O
empty O
throughout O
the O
night O
, O
they O
seated O
us O
right O
next O
to O
the O
swinging O
kitchen O
doors O
. O

Also O
, O
overheard O
gent O
at O
the O
next O
table U-NEU
complaining O
to O
the O
manager U-NEG
about O
his O
food U-NEG
. O

At O
1:15 O
we O
were O
still O
waiting U-NEG
for O
our O
plates U-NEU
! O

We O
sat O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
and O
were O
constantly O
bumped O
by O
the O
waitress U-NEG
flying O
past O
; O
had O
fabulously O
fresh O
raw O
oysters O
with O
pieces O
of O
shell O
in O
every O
bite O
; O
lobsters O
rolls U-POS
were O
tasty O
but O
the O
large O
pieces O
of O
meat O
were O
tough O
; O
the O
apple O
crumble O
was O
excellent O
but O
the O
ice B-NEG
cream L-NEG
was O
over O
- O
frozen O
and O
the O
stench O
of O
frying O
oil O
was O
nearly O
unbearable O
. O

Half O
the O
menu U-NEU
is O
comprised O
of O
original O
creations O
while O
the O
other O
half O
consists O
of O
unique O
slants O
on O
orthodox O
cuisine O
such O
as O
the O
single O
super O
- O
sized O
gnocchi U-POS
with O
cinammon O
. O

For O
Manhattanites O
like O
us O
that O
are O
used O
to O
pretentious O
attitudes U-NEG
and O
expensive O
tabs O
, O
this O
place O
is O
definitely O
a O
nice O
change O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
meatpacking O
district U-NEU
. O

The O
pancakes O
were O
good O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
have O
blueberry B-NEG
pancakes L-NEG
on O
the O
menu U-NEU
of O
you O
are O
not O
able O
to O
produce O
more O
than O
three O
tiny O
blueberries O
in O
each O
pancake O
. O

I O
had O
reservations U-NEU
for O
9:30pm O
and O
after O
waiting U-NEG
more O
that O
50 O
mins O
and O
bunch O
of O
lies O
that O
you O
're O
next O
. O

Otoro B-POS
tuna L-POS
, O
gorgeously O
marbled O
with O

, O

captivating O
; O
hamachi O
sashimi U-NEU
, O
topped O
by O
the O
chef U-NEU
with O
a O
whisper U-NEU
of O
sea B-NEU
salt L-NEU
and O
a O
barely O
- O
there O
squeeze O
of O
lemon O
, O
creates O
eye O
- O
rolling O
pleasure U-POS
. O

Dropped O
in O
for O
a O
quick O
bite O
with O
a O
friend O
-- O
like O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
it O
took O
more O
than O
15 O
minutes O
for O
any O
kind O
of O
service U-NEG
at O
all O
( O
including O
getting O
water U-NEU
) O
and O
then O
another O
45 O
minutes O
to O
get O
a O
burger O
( O
which O
admittedly O
was O
good O
) O
. O

Great O
pizza U-POS
for O
lunch U-NEU
place O
. O

seems O
everyone O
ordered O
sushi U-NEU
there O
were O
tons O
of O
delivery U-POS
orders O
( O
we O
can O
tell O
as O
we O
sat O
near O
the O
back O
) O
. O

Arrive O
at O
7:00pm O
, O
the O
waiters U-NEG
did O
n't O
give O
us O
our O
menus U-NEU
till O
an O
1 O
1/2 O
hour O
later O
. O

The O
round B-NEG
pizza L-NEG
does O
n't O
taste O
as O
good O
as O
I O
recall O
, O
it O
's O
still O
wonderful O
, O
but O
the O
Sicilian U-POS
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

I O
'm O
also O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
the O
chicken O
pizza O
on O
their O
new B-NEU
bar I-NEU
menu L-NEU
( O
no O
bread U-NEG
- O
weird O
, O
huh O
? O

Start O
with O
fennel B-NEU
- I-NEU
fragrant I-NEU
grilled I-NEU
sardines L-NEU
and O
the O
extraordinary O
pastas U-POS
, O
such O
as O
poppy O
- O
seeded O
sweet B-POS
beet I-POS
ravioli L-POS
, O
brown B-POS
- I-POS
butter I-POS

ricotta L-POS
malfatti O
( O
misshapen O
gnocchi O
with O

. O

Although O
I O
did O
n't O
pay O
for O
the O
meal O
( O
and O
it O
's O
about O
$ O
22 O
bucks O
a O
plate O
, O
way O
over O
my O
normal O
eating O
range U-NEG
) O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
it O
was O
better O
than O
any O
food U-NEU
I O
've O
ever O
had O
in O
little O
Italy O
, O
and O
there O
were O
n't O
any O
touristy O
elements O
to O
be O
found O
. O

But O
servers U-POS
, O
attentive O
if O
slightly O
unpolished O
, O
gladly O
direct O
inquisitors O
to O
menu U-NEU
strengths O
-- O
like O
rum O
- O
flambeed O
dessert O
bananas O
foster O
-- O
and O
allow O
leisurely O
enjoyment O
. O

I O
'm O
totally O
into O
the O
space O
- O
age O
vibe U-NEG
of O
this O
place O
, O
but O
I O
wish O
they O
had O
more O
tables U-POS
to O
sit O
down O
at O
. O

Ask O
for O
a O
table O
closer O
to O
the O
bar U-NEU
than O
in O
back O
of O
the O
dining O
area O
; O
the O
drop B-NEU
ceiling L-NEU
the O
back O
compromises O
enjoying O
the O
soaring O
space U-POS
of O
Guastavino O
's O
. O

When O
we O
got O
our O
bill U-NEU
the O
drinks U-NEU
were O
full O
priced O
and O
when O
we O
asked O
, O
our O
waitress U-NEG
said O
that O
there O
is O
no O
happy O
hour O
on O
the O
roof O
. O

The O
hostess U-NEG
was O
condescending O
and O
the O
waiter U-NEG
was O
somewhat O
absent O
and O
unaccomodating O
( O
sure O
, O
we O
made O
a O
reservation U-NEU
to O
sit O
outside O
but O
when O
I O
asked O
to O
be O
moved O
indoors O
after O
I O
heard O
thunder O
he O
did O
n't O
even O
try O
to O
make O
it O
happen O
, O
giving O
me O
a O
blank O
stare O
and O
a O
shrug O
when O
I O
asked O
what O
we O
would O
do O
if O
it O
rained O
) O
. O

The O
server U-NEG
was O
so O
busy O
the O
night O
we O
visited O
that O
she O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
our O
food U-NEU
order O
. O

The O
Food U-NEU
The O
versatile U-NEU
Austrian O

with O
French U-NEU
and O
American O
, O
rewards O

high O
and O

There O
are O
no O
price U-NEG
listed O
in O
the O
menu U-NEU
, O
and O
she O
will O
not O
provid O
them O
with O
a O
smile O
. O

The O
food U-POS
was O
served U-NEU
promptly O
and O
was O
really O
hot O
. O

The O
Food U-NEG
This O
is O
n't O
for O
those O
on O
a O
budget O
, O
but O
portions U-POS
are O
generous O
. O

When O
I O
could O
n't O
hear O
any O
of O
my O
selections O
in O
the O
dining B-NEU
room L-NEU
, O
the O
manager U-NEG
told O
me O
that O
the O
broken O
speakers O
in O
were O
' O
not O
his O
fault O
' O

Candles U-NEU
on O
the O
tables O
, O
cozy O
furnishings U-POS
and O
music U-POS
at O
just O
the O
right O
level O
make O
it O
a O
great O
dining O
experience U-POS
. O

I O
always O
find O
myself O
asking O
the O
waiter U-NEG
to O
make O
something O
bland O
and O
different O
than O
what O
is O
on O
the O
menu U-NEU
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
was O
that O
when O
I O
tried O
to O
go O
back O
with O
some O
friends O
on O
a O
crowded O
night O
, O
the O
place U-NEG
was O
packed O
, O
yet O
they O
told O
us O
there O
was O
a O
20 O
minute O
wait O
and O
that O
we O
should O
wait O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
. O

The O
wait U-NEG
for O
a O
table U-NEU
is O
interminable O
. O

Great O
value O
for O
the O
price-- O
lunch U-POS
is O
an O
even O
better O
value O
, O
with O
entree O
and O
appetizer U-NEU
for O
between O
$ O
8 O
- O
10 O
or O
so O
. O

Having O
eaten O
here O
for O
lunch U-NEU
many O
times O
, O
I O
can O
definitely O
vouch O
this O
place O
for O
having O
some O
of O
the O
best O
per B-POS
- I-POS
slice I-POS
Pizza L-POS
in O
the O
city O
. O

The O
food U-POS
and O
service U-POS
was O
top O
notch O
, O
only O
the O
complain O
is O
that O
this O
place O
is O
so O
small O
that O
some O
seats U-NEG
are O
not O
made O
for O
a O
big O
guy U-NEG
. O

went O
there O
for O
sunday O
brunch U-NEU
after O
a O
wonderful O
massage O
- O
the O
food U-NEG
was O
terrible O
- O
bland O
/ O
tasteless O
, O
cold O
, O
expensive O
. O

Our O
waitress U-NEG
did O
not O
take O
our O
drink U-NEU
order O
until O
I O
finally O
flagged O
her O
down O
and O
even O
then O
she O
seemed O
disinterested O
in O
our O
meal U-NEG
. O

wait B-NEG
staff L-NEG
have O
no O
room O
to O
get O
to O
tables O
because O
of O
overflow O
from O
bar B-NEU
area L-NEU
, O
and O
knocked O
into O
the O
back O
seats O
of O
our O
table O
constantly O
. O

The O
concoction U-NEG
was O
thrown O
away O
a O
mere O
two O
blocks O
from O
the O
Bar U-NEU
. O

Had O
the O
calamari B-NEU
app L-NEU
, O
which O
TGIFriday O
's O
makes O
better O
, O
and O
the O
scallop B-NEG
ceviche L-NEG
- O
that O
is O
NOT O
ceviche O
! O

the O
decor U-NEG
could O
be O
a O
bit O
better O
, O
and O
if O
there O
was O
a O
small O
bar U-NEG
the O
overall O
atmosphere U-POS
would O
be O
a O
bit O
more O
inviting O
( O
especially O
for O
regulars O
) O
. O

Maybe O
it O
was O
the O
choices O
the O
chefs O
had O
put O
on O
the O
Restaurant O
Week O
Menu U-NEU
, O
but O
much O
of O
our O
food U-NEG
was O
just O
so O
- O
so O
. O

I O
love O
the O
shrimp B-POS
summer I-POS
role L-POS
, O
chicken O
kabob O
's O
, O
and O
all O
the O
chicken O
and O
shrimp B-NEU
dishes L-NEU
. O

i O
got O
a O
steak B-NEG
special L-NEG
that O
was O
way O
overpriced O
( O
$ O
12 O
more O
then O
the O
steak O
on O
the O
menu U-NEU
and O
no O
warning O
from O
the O
waitress U-NEG
) O
and O
it O
was O
cooked O
to O
the O
wrong O
temperature U-NEG
. O

If O
people O
are O
late O
, O
you O
could O
lose O
your O
reservation U-NEU
and/or O
the O
staff U-NEG
does O
pressure O
you O
to O
start O
ordering O
even O
if O
your O
whole O
party O
has O
nt O
arrived O
. O

People O
will O
literally O
spend O
their O
entire O
lunch U-NEU
break O
waiting U-NEU
and O
for O
what O
- O
an O
average O
fastfood O
burger U-NEG
. O

If O
you O
like O
an O
ecclectic O
crowd O
and O
an O
overall O
good O
time U-POS
where O
you O
and O
your O
friends O
can O
get O
together O
whether O
it O
be O
to O
eat O
, O
drink U-NEU
or O
just O
play O
some O
good O
old O
pictionary O
( O
they O
provide O
crayons O
and O
a O
blank O
white O
sheet U-NEU
at O
every O
table O
) O
, O
go O
to O
the O
Cargo O
! O

Now O
a O
sleek O
, O
cool O
lounge U-POS
with O
refreshing O
new B-POS
color L-POS
, O
lighting O
and O
surfaces O
, O
Fig O
27 O
mirrors U-NEU
its O
around O
the O
corner O
sibling O
, O
PS450 O
with O
a O
yummy O
menu U-POS
of O
small O
bites O
, O
great O
drinks U-POS
and O
wonderful O
staff U-POS
. O

We O
would O
rather O
pay O
more O
prices U-NEG
and O
expect O
the O
better O
food U-POS
and O
service O
. O

We O
finally O
flagged O
down O
another O
server U-NEG
who O
brought O
us O
more O
to O
drink U-NEU
, O
and O
then O
they O
took O
forever O
with O
the O
check O
. O

When O
we O
asked O
a O
waiter U-NEG
for O
an O
explanation O
of O
the O
long O
wait O
with O
some O
many O
empty O
tables U-NEU
he O
had O
no O
answer O
so O
we O
asked O
for O
the O
manager U-NEU
. O

went O
here O
late O
night O
after O
a O
a O
few O
drinks U-NEU
at O
my O
favorite O
watering O
spot U-POS
and O
was O
amazed O
that O
a O
place O
which O
serves O
food O
till O
4 O
can O
be O
so O
damned O
good O
. O

Although O
she O
was O
obviously O
busy O
, O
she O
was O
helpful O
in O
describing O
certain O
items O
on O
the O
menu U-NEU
and O
suggested O
a O
duck B-POS
dish L-POS
that O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

THe O
bartendars U-POS
were O
right O
on O
top O
of O
getting O
us O
our O
wine U-NEU
and O
setting O
up O
free O
blue O
cheese O
dip O
and O
chips O
for O
us O
. O

The O
lunch U-NEU
got O
a O
little O
bizarre O
when O
we O
asked O
the O
waiter U-NEG
how O
the O
joint O
got O
it O
's O
name O
, O
and O
he O
made O
his O
hands O
into O
cups O
in O
reference O
to O
placing O
them O
on O
a O
woman O
's O
breasts O
and O
said O
, O
No O
, O
not O
this O
. O

The O
waitstaff U-NEG
are O
surprisingly O
uninformed O
and O
unintelligent O
, O
and O
I O
say O
this O
even O
though O
I O
liked O
my O
waiter U-POS
. O

Right O
after O
we O
finished O
the O
main O
course O
( O
the O
organic B-NEG
chicken L-NEG
was O
dry O
) O
, O
but O
before O
we O
finish O
drinking O
the O
wine U-NEU
the O
check O
was O
placed O
on O
the O
table O
, O
and O
the O
waitress U-NEG
came O
back O
and O
picked O
it O
up O
three O
times O
. O

The O
outdoor B-POS
patio L-POS
is O
really O
nice O
in O
good O
weather O
, O
but O
what O
ambience U-NEU
the O
indoors O
possesses O
is O
negated O
by O
the O
noise O
and O
the O
crowds O
. O

The O
Food U-NEU
There O
's O
a O
trimmed O

down O
version O
of O
the O
regular O
Blue B-NEU

all O

of O

and O
a O
solid O
selection O

the O
real O

is O
the O
vast O

well O

vegetable B-POS
portions L-POS
( O
goodies O
like O
foie O
gras O
terrine O
aside O
, O
the O
meat O
selections O
are O
disappointingly O
indistinct O
) O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
food U-NEU
has O
a O
vinegary O
flavor U-POS
( O
I O
think O
because O
of O
the O
injera O
) O
. O

It O
does O
get O
crowded O
with O
plenty O
of O
blue B-NEG
shirted I-NEG
cigar L-NEG
smoking O
wannabes O
, O
so O
make O
a O
reservation U-NEU
. O

My O
bass U-NEG
was O
even O
worse O
- O
smothered O
in O
some O
kind O
of O
tomato B-NEU
sauce L-NEU
that O
just O
did O
not O
go O
with O
fish U-NEG
and O
the O
spinach U-NEG
that O
accompanied O
the O
dish U-NEG
was O
extremely O
dry O
and O
flavorless O
. O

service U-POS
was O
attentive O
at O
the O
beginning O
but O
the O
waiter U-NEG
lost O
us O
towards O
the O
end O
and O
we O
had O
to O
flag O
them O
down O
for O
the O
check O
. O

For O
the O
price U-NEU
( O
$ O
8) O
, O
the O
quality B-POS
of I-POS
the I-POS
buffet L-POS
is O
great O
! O

Last O
, O
but O
not O
least O
, O
when O
we O
walked O
in O
, O
most O
of O
the O
clientelle U-NEG
was O
Vietnamese O
and O
next O
to O
us O
was O
a O
food U-NEU
critic O
whose O
review O
was O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
menu U-NEU
. O

The O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
Mercadito O
is O
All O
style O
and O
No O
substance O
( O
the O
drinks U-NEU
had O
far O
too O
much O
salad U-NEG
and O
seasoning U-NEG
in O
them O
. O

The O
atmosphere U-POS
was O
warm O
, O
sexy O
, O
and O
very O
romantic O
but O
the O
lighting U-NEG
was O
n't O
good O
for O
reading O
the O
menu U-NEU
. O

After O
reading O
the O
negative O
sushi U-NEG
reviews O
, O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
opted O
for O
their O
Korean B-NEU
fare L-NEU
. O

With O
all O
of O
the O
kitchen O
goof O
- O
ups O
( O
appetizer U-NEU
coming O
out O
before O
the O
entree O
and O
one O
entree O
coming O
out O
ten O
minutes O
before O
the O
other O
) O
you O
would O
think O
that O
the O
wait B-POS
staff L-POS
would O
have O
been O
more O
attentive O
. O

One O
Entree U-NEU
from O
their O
restaraunt O
is O
enough O
to O
fill O
two O
adults O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
that O
all O
their O
dishes U-POS
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

When O
I O
asked O
the O
waitress U-NEU
, O
she O
told O
me O
they O
could O
n't O
afford O
the O
salmon U-NEG
, O
and O
had O
changed O
the O
dish U-NEU
( O
though O
not O
on O
the O
menu O
) O
. O

I O
had O
reservations U-NEU
for O
a O
week O
but O
was O
seated O
at O
the O
worst O
table B-NEG
in I-NEG
the I-NEG
room L-NEG
, O
against O
a O
wall O
near O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
kitchen O
, O
very O
claustaphobic O
. O

The O
food U-NEU
was O
a O
mix B-POS
of I-POS
sandwiches L-POS
, O
salads U-POS
and O
appetizers U-POS
that O
were O
mostly O
healthy O
and O
had O
a O
nice O
Brazilian O
touch O
. O

My O
vegetable B-POS
Napoleon L-POS
was O
good O
; O
although O
i O
first O
got O
the O
veggie B-NEU
burger L-NEU
because O
the O
waitress O
mis O
- O
heard O
and O
stood O
my O
friend O
up O
for O
another O
15 O
minutes O
of O
waiting U-NEG
to O
have O
it O
served O
. O

If O
you O
're O
going O
to O
label O
spicy O
items O
on O
your O
menu U-NEU
as O
spicy O
( O
like O
the O
Buffalo O
and O
Cajun B-POS
wraps L-POS
) O
, O
I O
think O
you O
should O
go O
ahead O
and O
label O
all O
the O
spicy O
items O
as O
spicy O
. O

The O
waitress U-NEG
took O
our O
menu U-NEU
away O
, O
without O
taking O
our O
food U-NEU
order O
! O

Great O
for O
those O
hungover O
mornings O
when O
you O
need O
a O
decent O
pint O
and O
delicious O
, O
homemade B-POS
food L-POS
that O
will O
tide O
you O
over O
for O
the O
whole O
day U-NEU
. O

Into O
our O
appetizer U-NEU
, O
an O
adjacent O
table O
became O
available O
, O
and O
we O
asked O
if O
we O
could O
use O
it O
, O
but O
the O
waiter U-NEG
said O
it O
most O
likely O
was O
being O
used O
. O

To O
make O
matters O
worse O
an O
hour O
into O
our O
dinner U-NEU
we O
see O
a O
waiter U-NEG
take O
mojitos U-NEU
to O
another O
table O
. O

we O
had O
dinner U-NEU
at O
becco O
on O
a O
friday O
night O
, O
and O
were O
seated O
in O
the O
left O
bar O
area O
, O
which O
while O
pretty O
crowded O
, O
had O
a O
manageable O
noise B-NEG
level L-NEG
. O

The O
huge O
terrace U-POS
is O
just O
so O
beautiful O
-- O
and O
rumor O
has O
it O
they O
'll O
be O
tenting O
the O
space U-NEU
this O
fall O
, O
so O
we O
midtowners O
can O
continue O
to O
dine O
outside O
through O
the O
end O
of O
the O
year O
. O

about O
10 O
minutes O
apart O
each O
, O
so O
we O
were O
all O
eating O
cold O
eggs U-NEG
by O
the O
time O
we O
got O
our O
food U-NEU
. O

After O
demanding O
a O
free O
round O
of O
drinks U-NEU
from O
a O
third O
manager U-NEG
, O
our O
party O
decided O
to O
bail O
on O
this O
horrific O
french O
import O
. O

Been O
there O
a O
few O
times O
for O
dinner U-NEU
, O
brunch O
or O
just O
a O
drink U-NEU
( O
the O
French B-POS
cosmos L-POS
are O
fantastic O
) O
and O
it O
just O
keeps O
getting O
better O
. O

Steak O
- O
Porterhouse O
for O
2 O
was O
served O
for O
1 O
, O
overspiced O
, O
overpriced O
and O
tasted O
frozen O
, O
with O
a O
hint O
of O
msg B-POS
Dessert L-POS
- O
best O
part O
of O

, O
good O

Overall O
- O
if O

quality L-NEU
matters O
to O
you O
over O
pretty O
lights O
and O
models O
handing O
you O
towels O
in O
the O
bathroom O
, O
i O
do O
n't O
recommend O
. O

They O
served O
the O
salad U-NEU
and O
the O
main B-NEU
course L-NEU
together O
and O
did O
n't O
even O
bring O
the O
dessert B-NEG
menu L-NEG
. O

This O
happened O
while O
many O
diners U-NEU
were O
enjoying O
their O
meal U-POS
and O
it O
was O
rudes O
. O

The O
food U-POS
was O
good O
( O
and O
the O
$ O
25 O
prix B-POS
fixe L-POS
made O
it O
all O
that O
much O
better O
) O
, O
but O
the O
dinner O
started O
to O
feel O
like O
an O
assembly O
line O
when O
our O
appetizer U-NEU
arrived O
5 O
minutes O
after O
ordering O
. O

We O
preferred O
to O
gaze O
at O
our O
burgers U-NEU
while O
avoiding O
having O
to O
look O
at O
the O
wait B-NEG
staff L-NEG
, O
but O
no O
complaints O
. O

Interesting O
crowd O
for O
people O
watching O
- O
old O
school O
Italian O
music U-POS
cranking O
- O
friendly O
Italian O
waitress U-POS
brought O
us O
our O
wine B-NEU
garlic I-NEU
bread L-NEU
in O
no O
time O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
even O
have O
time O
to O
finish O
my O
single O
cocktail U-NEU
and O
the O
waiter U-NEG
did O
n't O
even O
ask O
if O
we O
wanted O
coffee U-NEU
but O
instead O
, O
gave O
us O
our O
check O
without O
us O
even O
requesting O
it O
. O

All O
the O
food U-POS
was O
carefully O
prepared O
and O
the O
presentation U-NEU
was O
a O
cut O
above O
. O

They O
have O
possibly O
the O
worst O
service U-NEG
in O
New O
York O
I O
have O
waited O
until O
the O
waiter U-NEG
has O
finished O
his O
paper O
, O
begged O
for O
water U-NEU
and O
waited O
over O
an O
hour O
for O
my O
meal U-NEU
. O

When O
my O
( O
pregnant O
) O
friend O
asked O
about O
a O
non O
- O
alcoholic O
version O
of O
a O
drink U-NEU
, O
the O
answer U-NEG
was O
simply O
no O
, O
with O
no O
further O
suggestions O
. O

i O
think O
friends O
coffee U-NEU
shop O
makes O
great O
food O
the O
service U-POS
is O
great O
and O
they O
are O
very O
poilte O
i O
think O
that O
they O
should O
open O
more O
because O
there O
the O
best O
food O
store O
i O
ever O
ate O
from O
the O
food O
is O
addicting O
and O
you O
ca O
nt O
stop O
eating O
because O
it O
so O
delious O
. O

From O
beginning B-NEU
appetizers L-NEU
, O
the O
scallops U-POS
were O
incredible O
, O
to O
the O
delicious O
chocolate B-POS
souffle I-POS
with I-POS
rasberry I-POS
mint I-POS
sorbet L-POS
, O
we O
were O
delighted O
by O
the O
taste O
sensations O
. O

The O
waiter U-NEG
did O
n't O
know O
the O
menu U-NEU
, O
did O
n't O
bring O
more O
than O
one O
item O
at O
a O
time O
, O
and O
put O
some O
orders O
in O
twice O
with O
the O
kitchen U-NEU
. O

deserts U-NEG
were O
slow O
to O
order O
as O
waiters U-NEG
passed O
us O
twice O
, O
even O
with O
the O
menus B-NEU
closed L-NEU
. O

They O
are O
negligent O
in O
alerting O
customers O
when O
an O
order O
is O
ready O
- O
you O
could O
end O
up O
waiting U-NEU
for O
half O
an O
hour O
while O
your O
food U-NEG
is O
sitting O
on O
their O
counter U-NEU
getting O
cold O
. O

I O
was O
at O
Son O
Cubano O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
, O
and O
although O
i O
was O
only O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
( O
without O
prior O
reservations U-NEU
which O
are O
a O
must O
) O
, O
i O
had O
an O
awesome O
time U-POS
. O

The O
busboys U-POS
were O
more O
helpful O
than O
my O
server U-NEG
who O
then O
made O
me O
wait O
at O
the O
bar O
( O
very O
crowded O
with O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
tasty O
margaritas O
) O
to O
pay O
the O
bartender U-NEG
- O
what O
's O
that O
about O
? O

There O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
scensters O
who O
could O
nt O
afford O
dinner U-NEG
hanging O
in O
the O
waiting B-NEU
area L-NEU
so O
we O
got O
bumped O
around O
a O
lot O
. O

Our O
food U-NEG
took O
forever O
, O
the O
bartender U-NEG
seemed O
more O
interested O
in O
refilling O
drinks U-NEU
for O
the O
regulars O
and O
never O
even O
brought O
bread U-NEU
or O
water O
, O
as O
requested O
. O

Renderings O
of O
mythical O
creatures O
festoon O
its O
walls O
, O
and O
heavily O
tattooed O
waitresses U-NEG
pick O
up O
orders O
from O
the O
open B-NEU
kitchen L-NEU
and O
chat O
at O
the O
small O
bar U-NEG
. O

The O
staff U-NEG
even O
went O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
print O
up O
menus U-NEU
without O
prices O
at O
my O
request O
, O
since O
the O
dinner U-NEU
party O
was O
my O
treat O
. O

Despite O
reservations U-NEU
, O
we O
ended O
up O
waiting U-NEG
for O
1hr+ O

The O
mussels B-POS
marina L-POS
are O
a O
must O
for O
an O
appetizer U-NEU
, O
although O
you O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
with O
the O
stuffed O
artichoke O
either O
. O

the O
waiter U-NEG
did O
n't O
recommen O
any O
special O
for O
the O
night O
, O
did O
n't O
come O
back O
to O
the O
table U-NEU
to O
check O
if O
everything O
is O
okay O
, O
did O
n't O
even O
offer O
me O
the O
dessert B-NEU
menu L-NEU
at O
the O
end O
. O

The O
trick O
to O
the O
tomato B-NEU
and I-NEU
onions L-NEU
is O
ask O
for O
it O
light O
on O
the O
onions O
, O
heavy O
on O
the O
tomatoes U-POS
, O
order O
steak O
for O
one O
less O
person O
than O
you O
have O
in O
your O
party O
and O
if O
the O
steak O
is O
too O
rare O
, O
you O
can O
cook O
the O
individual O
pieces O
more O
by O
placing O
them O
on O
the O
platter O
around O
the O
edges O
. O

My O
party O
felt O
like O
we O
got O
put O
in O
a O
dining B-NEU
room L-NEU
for O
tourist O
, O
which O
must O
have O
been O
the O
penalty O
box O
area O
for O
the O
disgruntled O
wait B-NEG
staff L-NEG
on O
duty O
. O

then O
the O
manager U-NEG
gave O
us O
lemon B-NEU
juice L-NEU
instead O
of O
ceasar B-NEU
dressing L-NEU
for O
a O
ceasar O
salad O
which O
ruined O
the O
salad O
. O

The O
Scene U-NEU
You O
wo O
n't O
blink O
twice O
at O
the O
restaurant O
's O
spartan O
decor U-POS
: O
As O
the O
packed O
crowds O
and O
critics O
' O
praises O
wallpapering O
the O
front O
wall O
agree O
, O
this O
longtime O
local O
favorite O
is O
truly O
one O
of O
the O
area O
's O
most O
exquisite O
finds O
. O

But O
on O
a O
recent O
Sunday O
brunch U-NEU
excursion O
, O
I O
was O
greeted O
by O
a O
uniformly O
unfriendly O
staff O
- O
starting O
with O
the O
hostess U-NEG
and O
extending O
to O
foul O
faced O
wait B-NEG
staff L-NEG
. O

Our O
waiter U-NEU
brought O
out O
three O
main B-NEU
courses L-NEU
, O
but O
the O
fourth O
was O
n't O
ready O
so O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
10 O
minutes O
for O
the O
last O
dish U-NEU
to O
arrive O
, O
but O
they O
were O
very O
nice O
and O
gave O
us O
free O
red B-POS
pepper I-POS
hummus L-POS
while O
we O
waited O
. O

Had O
a O
mouthwatering O
sardinian B-POS
Stuffed I-POS
Squid L-POS
and O
a O
Catfish U-NEU
fiumarola O
from O
Rome O
( O
think O
was O
capers O
and O
anchovies O
sauce U-NEU
) O
. O

The O
service U-POS
was O
great O
-- O
my O
glass O
was O
refilled O
without O
having O
to O
ask O
, O
we O
were O
greeted O
by O
the O
manager U-POS
that O
day O
to O
ask O
how O
our O
food U-NEU
was O
. O

got O
the O
guac U-NEU
but O
no O
drinks U-NEG
until O
it O
was O
all O
gone O
( O
approximately O
20 O
minutes O
later O
) O
. O

Although O
when O
I O
went O
to O
eat O
dinner U-NEU
at O
Bombay O
Talkie O
on O
a O
crazy O
busy O
night O
, O
my O
waiter U-POS
was O
extremely O
helpful O
through O
the O
menu U-NEU
, O
polite O
and O
polished O
. O

Towards O
the O
end O
of O
our O
meal U-NEU
, O
a O
server U-NEG
came O
out O
, O
apparently O
our O
orders O
had O
been O
double O
- O
filled O
. O

This O
place O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
served U-POS
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O
customer O
service U-NEG
. O

Only O
thing O
we O
did O
n't O
like O
was O
the O
steamed B-NEG
chocolate I-NEG
cake I-NEG
with I-NEG
mint I-NEG
ice L-NEG
creama O
group O
of O
the O
4 O
of O
us O
did O
not O
want O
to O
finish O
this O
dessert U-NEU
! O

The O
situation O
was O
verified O
by O
taking O
3 O
dishes U-NEU
that O
were O
over O
an O
hour O
late O
off O
the O
bill U-NEU
and O
free O
desserts U-POS
and O
coffee O
but O
the O
experience O
left O
most O
of O
us O
never O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
the O
supposed O
hip O
cool O
66 O
ever O
again O

The O

I O
went O
there O
about O
three O
times O
, O
one O
for O
dinner U-NEU
on O
a O
sunday O
evening O
which O
is O
a O
salsa O
night O
after O
dinning O
, O
the O
service U-NEG
was O
slow O
and O
a O
bit O
rude O
, O
the O
plates O
average O
some O
shrimp B-NEU
octopus L-NEU

If O
you O
do O

care O
about O
the O
wait B-NEG
staff L-NEG
as O
long O
as O
they O
bring O
you O
your O

then O
go O
to O
Opa O
. O

Food O
was O
average O
, O
the O
appetizers U-POS
were O
better O
than O
the O
main B-NEU
courses L-NEU
. O

Sure O
the O
food U-POS
was O
- O
as O
always O
- O
very O
good O
, O
but O
we O
were O
quite O
outrageous O
about O
the O
waitress U-NEG
. O

I O
go O
there O
to O
eat O
dinner U-NEU
, O
brunch O
, O
or O
to O
just O
drink U-NEU
and O
hang O
out O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
with O
the O
friendly O
staff U-POS
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
had O
dinner U-NEU
here O
last O
week O
and O
the O
food U-POS
was O
very O
good O
. O

Bouley O
has O
done O
an O
excellent O
job O
creating O
this O
dining B-NEU
establishment L-NEU
with O
almost O
a O
museum O
sense O
, O
the O
artworks U-POS
on O
the O
wall O
have O
a O
very O
Klimty O
feeling O
and O
the O
gold B-POS
ceiling L-POS
completes O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
experience O
. O

The O
service U-POS
was O
polite O
, O
friendly O
and O
prompt O
, O
the O
characters O
walking O
around O
entertained O
the O
kids O
but O
were O
nt O
intrusive O
to O
our O
meal U-NEU
. O

Includes O
a O
diverse O
array O
of O
entrees U-POS
ranging O
from O
Boar O
( O
prepared O
in O
your O
choice O
of O
either O
the O
French O
or O
Asian O
tradition O
) O
, O
Mussels U-NEU
, O
or O
Pad O
Thai O
that O
grace O
the O
menu U-NEU
all O
at O
once O
, O
each O
one O
prepared O
in O
a O
distinctly O
different O
and O
delicate O
sauce O
. O

we O
live O
down O
the O
street O
and O
have O
eaten O
here O
many O
times O
for O
lunch U-NEU
and O
dinner U-NEU
, O
and O
the O
food U-POS
is O
consistently O
terrific O
. O

Service U-POS
has O
improved O
drastically O
from O
the O
old O
days O
, O
you O
are O
now O
seated O
by O
a O
hostess U-NEU
instead O
of O
standing O
behind O
a O
nearby O
table O
waiting O
for O
them O
to O
finish O
. O

The O
service U-POS
was O
great O
, O
the O
chef U-NEU
even O
gave O
me O
a O
complimentary O
dish U-POS
. O

We O
asked O
for O
bread O
plates O
when O
the O
bread O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
table U-NEU
and O
the O
server U-NEG
's O
response O
was O
management U-NEG
has O
decided O
not O
to O
offer O
bread O
plates O
. O

Service U-NEG
was O
prompt O
, O
although O
at O
times O
the O
waiters O
seemed O
to O
be O
spending O
more O
time O
dealing O
with O
the O
overflow O
from O
the O
bar U-NEU
than O
the O
diners U-NEU
( O
ever O
heard O
of O
cocktail B-NEU
waiters L-NEU
) O
. O

the O
place O
has O
an O
awesome O
decore U-POS
, O
with O
fish U-POS
swiming O
below O
certain O
tables U-NEU
. O

I O
had O
a O
9 O
pm O
reservation O
and O
wound O
up O
sitting O
down O
closer O
to O
10 O
, O
but O
the O
bar U-NEU
was O
entertaining O
enough O
for O
the O
almost O
- O
an O
- O
hour O
wait O
( O
excellent O
martinis U-POS
) O
. O

Lobster B-POS
ceviche L-POS
was O
amazing O
pared O
with O
mango U-NEU
. O

The O
place O
was O
packed O
and O
while O
our O
food U-NEU
took O
time O
to O
be O
prepared O
, O
our O
waiter U-POS
earned O
points O
for O
his O
sparkling O
conversation O
to O
pass O
time O
and O
for O
also O
knowing O
practically O
every O
ingredient O
of O
every O
special O
under O
consideration O
. O

Decor U-POS
is O
old O
, O
but O
the O
bathrooms U-NEG
are O
clean O
and O
updated O
. O

Prices U-POS
are O
reasonable O
, O
probably O
$ O
55 O
/ O
pp O
with O
appetizers U-NEU
, O
main B-NEU
course L-NEU
, O
dessert O
and O
a O
drink U-NEU
. O

This O
was O
not O
the O
same O
hostess U-NEU
I O
usually O
see O
there O
who O
happens O
to O
be O
very O
sweet O
and O
provides O
excellent O
service U-POS
. O

There O
is O
nothing O
else O
on O
the O
menu U-NEU
except O
for O
exotic B-NEU
teas L-NEU
and O
cold O
beverages U-NEG
, O
but O
with O
a O
meal U-POS
this O
cheap O
and O
delightful O
, O
who O
would O
care O
? O

The O
servers U-NEG
were O
snobby O
and O
got O
mad O
at O
me O
when O
I O
asked O
if O
they O
serve O
by O
the O
slice U-NEU
. O

I O
have O
reservations U-NEU
about O
the O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
deal O
, O
however O
-- O
the O
choices U-NEG
are O
fairly O
limited O
and O
you O
can O
probably O
order O
more O
food U-POS
than O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
less O
than O
$ O
18 O
by O
just O
going O
off O
the O
menu U-NEU
. O

Try O
the O
olive B-POS
cream I-POS
cheese L-POS
or O
the O
lox B-POS
spread L-POS
on O
a O
whole O
wheat O
everything O
bagel U-NEU
. O

Sometimes O
I O
grow O
a O
bit O
weary O
of O
dining U-NEU
in O
those O
pretentious O
, O
haughty O
taughty O
, O
high O
fashion O
eateries U-NEG
. O

The O
meat U-POS
was O
great O
, O
but O
vegetables U-NEG
needed O
flavor O
and O
etc O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
, O
drink U-NEU
and O
enjoy O
the O
pleasures U-POS
of O
food U-POS
, O
Sam O

your O
new O
home O
away O
from O
home O

While O
they O
adhere O
to O
a O
certain O
traditionality O
in O
serving U-NEU
their O
teas U-NEU
; O
eg O
: O
samovar O
for O
the O
russian O
, O
chinese O
tea O
sets O
for O
the O
green O
, O
the O
food U-NEU
labours O
under O
no O
such O
restrictions O
and O
there O
is O
nothing O
ordinary O
on O
the O
menu U-NEG
. O

For O
a O
normal O
dinner U-NEU
, O
I O
prefer O
a O
place O
that O
has O
a O
bit O
more O
room O
and O
that O
has O
a O
slightly O
more O
relaxed O
vibe U-POS
. O

Shun O
Lee O
has O
been O
serving O
creative O
Chinese B-POS
food L-POS
in O
a O
deluxe B-NEU
dining I-NEU
room L-NEU
for O
30 O
years O
-- O
they O
must O
be O
doing O
something O
right O
! O

The O
smoked B-POS
salmon I-POS
appetizer L-POS
was O
pretty O
good O
( O
it O
comes O
with O
goat B-NEU
cheese L-NEU
, O
calpers O
and O
onions U-NEU
) O
. O

The O
staff U-POS
was O
courteous O
and O
explained O
the O
menu O
with O
detail U-NEU
. O

Reservations U-NEU
are O
no O
guarantee O
of O
prompt O
seating O
, O
have O
a O
pre B-NEU
- I-NEU
game I-NEU
drink L-NEU
, O
pop O
a O
xanax O
and O
you O
can O
handle O
the O
drama O
of O
having O
a O
res O
and O
getting O
no O
love O
from O
the O
hostess U-POS
. O

Soy O
abounds O
, O
in O
all O
forms O
: O
as O
firm O
patties U-NEG
, O
pure O
squares O
of O
glistening O
tofu U-NEU
, O
and O
something O
called O
a O
hijiki O
patty O
-- O
mixed U-POS
tastily O
with O
shreds O
of O
seaweed O
, O
then O
fried O
. O

there O
's O
always O
people O
waiting U-NEU
to O
be O
seated O
and O
the O
chairs U-NEG
are O
not O
comfortable O
. O

The O
host O
was O
playing O
god O
with O
his O
headset O
and O
reservation O
list O
, O
the O
bar U-NEU
was O
packed O
with O
horney O
drunken O
investment O
bankers O
, O
reservations U-NEG
are O
a O
joke O
and O
after O
haplessly O
sliding O
the O
plates O
at O
us O
when O
serving O
the O
food U-NEU
, O
they O
could O
n't O
wait O
to O
collect O
the O
plates O
until O
we O
were O
done O
. O

Instead O
, O
Yasuda O
's O
swarm O
of O
waiters O
and O
waitresses U-NEG
hovered O
incessantly O
overhead O
, O
seizing O
any O
opportunity O
to O
fill O
a O
glass U-NEU
, O
reorganize O
the O
table O
, O
ask O
if O
we O
were O
done O
, O
and O
of O
course O
clear O
us O
out O
of O
there O
in O
under O
80 O
min O
. O

I O
love O
Chinese B-POS
food L-POS
and O
have O
been O
looking O
for O
the O
alternative O
to O
the O
greasy O
stuff U-POS
on O
every O
corner O
of O
New O
York- O
ya O
, O
you O
know O
, O
the O
stinky O
take O
- O
out O
joints O
that O
leave O
you O
smelling O
like O
dinner U-NEU
for O
100 O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
! O

Our O
waitress U-NEG
was O
a O
bit O
cold O
but O
she O
was O
still O
attentive O
and O
food U-POS
came O
quickly O
. O

One O
would O
think O
we O
'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks U-NEU
- O
instead O
, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter U-NEG
would O
n't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O
. O

The O
Food U-NEU
The O
classic O
Italian B-POS
menu L-POS
gets O
off O
to O
a O
good O
start O
with O
Queen O
's O
famous O
bread U-POS
basket O
, O
which O
is O
loaded O
with O
a O
slew O
of O
crunchy O
, O
yeasty O
homemade O
varieties U-POS
. O

That O
's O
almost O
enough O
to O
prove O
its O
legitimacy O
to O
me O
, O
but O
eating O
there O
, O
both O
for O
a O
quick O
slice O
and O
sit O
- O
down O
for O
pasta U-POS
with O
my O
family U-NEU
has O
always O
been O
a O
delicious O
, O
inexpensive O
and O
fun O
experience O
. O

Mac B-NEG
cheese L-NEG
is O
nothing O
to O
write O
home O
about O
; O
the O
beet B-NEG
salad L-NEG
is O
boring O
, O
mostly O
lettuce O
; O
tuna B-NEU
sandwhich L-NEU
- O
boring O
, O
mostly O
mayo O
; O
the O
french O
fries O
looked O
re O
- O
fried O
and O
were O
cold O
; O
the O
excellent O
pork O
sandwich O
came O
on O
one O
of O
those O
supermarket O
hot O
- O
dog O
buns O
. O

Ok O
I O
got O
the O
edamame U-NEU
and O
something O
from O
the O
sushi B-POS
chef L-POS
for O
free O
, O
but O
the O
quality B-POS
of I-POS
food L-POS
is O
more O
important O
to O
me O
than O
a O
free O
small O
dish U-POS
( O
maybe O
that O
's O
why O
the O
restaurant O
gives O
it O
to O
attact O
new O
customers O
. O

We O
were O
directed O
to O
a O
table U-NEU
by O
a O
member O
of O
staff U-NEG
, O
which O
we O
were O
then O
informed O
was O
reserved O
, O
and O
lost O
our O
seats U-NEG
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
, O
all O
this O
after O
spending O
upwards O
of O
$ O
30 O
each O
on O
very O
expensive O
drinks O
over O
a O
two O
- O
hour O
period O
. O

After O
our O
meal U-NEU
, O
the O
manager U-POS
, O
even O
took O
some O
of O
his O
time O
to O
sit O
with O
us O
and O
give O
us O
a O
lesson O
in O
Sake O
101 O
. O

So O
if O
he O
ca O
n't O
find O
fresh O
- O
good O
product O
, O
he O
'll O
remove O
a O
dish U-POS
from O
the O
menu U-NEU
which O
I O
think O
is O
fantastic O
. O

This O
much O
heralded O
restaurant O
brought O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
some O
excitement O
as O
we O
walked O
in O
the O
door U-NEU
, O
but O
we O
were O
met O
with O
an O
awkward O
maitre'd O
who O
barely O
spoke O
to O
us O
at O
all O
and O
just O
seemed O
standoff O
- O
ish O
. O

we O
were O
in O
haven O
from O
appetizers U-NEU
, O
my O
favorite O
was O
the O
tuna B-POS
tartare L-POS
, O
to O
the O
dim B-POS
sum L-POS
, O
the O
best O
was O
shrimp U-POS
and O
foie B-POS
gras I-POS
dumpling L-POS
, O
and O
i O
could O
go O
on O
and O
on O
, O
everything O
was O
an O
explosion O
of O
flavors U-POS
. O

The O
prices U-POS
seemed O
reasonable O
with O
entrees U-NEU
ranging O
from O
$ O
14-$25 O
. O

it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
place O
the O
bar U-NEU
closer O
to O
the O
front U-NEU
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
away O
from O
the O
tables U-NEG
. O

we O
wanted O
to O
join O
another O
2 O
top O
table U-NEU
to O
ours O
and O
the O
manager U-NEG
abruptly O
said O
, O
that O
wo O
n't O
work O
for O
us O
! O

The O
only O
drawback O
was O
slow O
service U-NEG
, O
but O
the O
food U-POS
and O
ambience U-POS
are O
so O
nice O
that O
your O
wait U-POS
is O
A O
) O
pleasant O
and O
B O
) O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
like O
the O
somosas U-POS
, O
chai U-POS
, O
and O
the O
chole U-POS
, O
but O
the O
dhosas U-NEG
and O
dhal U-NEG
were O
kinda O
dissapointing O
. O

Dinner U-NEU
is O
okay O
- O
not O
many O
vegetarian O
options O
, O
and O
the O
portions U-NEG
are O
small O
. O

Not O
a O
destination O
restaurant O
, O
but O
if O
you O
're O
hungry O
for O
breakfast U-NEU
or O
lunch O
, O
big O
portions U-POS
and O
good O
quality U-POS
for O
the O
money O
. O

Had O
a O
dinner O
date O
( O
her O
suggestion O
) O
:) O
Had O
the O
mussels U-POS
( O
really O
good O
) O
and O
smoked B-NEG
salmon L-NEG
( O
not O
the O
best O
) O
for O
appys U-NEU
. O

In O
Short O
The O
vegi O
burgers O
( O
and O
the O
full B-POS
bar L-POS
) O
are O
the O
main O
draws O
: O
ranging O
from O
the O
Super O
Veg O
- O
Burger O
with O
lettuce O
, O
tomato U-NEU
and O
Abijah B-NEU

, O
special O

, O

, O
dairy O
or O
nondairy O
cheese O
, O
etc O
. O

Our O
server U-NEG
did O
not O
check O
on O
us O
, O
ask O
if O
we O
needed O
anything O
, O
refill O
our O
water U-NEU
or O
get O
our O
dessert U-NEU
order O
right O
. O

Between O
the O
seven O
of O
us O
we O
sampled O
just O
about O
everything O
on O
the O
menu U-NEU
, O
and O
nothing O
disappointed O
( O
ribs U-POS
pulled O
pork U-POS
seemed O
like O
the O
biggest O
hits O
) O
. O

However O
, O
when O
our O
waitress U-NEG
realized O
her O
faux O
pas O
, O
an O
extra O
glass B-NEU
of I-NEU
wine L-NEU
was O
sent O
to O
our O
table U-NEU
and O
all O
was O
forgiven O
. O

( O
Though O
the O
filet U-NEG
wo O
n't O
be O
enough O
if O
both O
have O
hearty O
apitites U-POS
. O

The O
prices U-POS
were O
n't O
bad O
though O
- O
dinner U-NEU
ended O
up O
at O
$ O
80 O
with O
tip U-NEU
and O
we O
had O
a O

well O

impressive O
balcony O

while O
they O
forgot O
to O
give O
us O
the O
cold O
appetizers O
, O
the O
waiter U-POS
and O
maitre'd O
more O
than O
made O
up O
for O
it O
by O
being O
most O
accomodating O
to O
us O
. O

The O
Clinton O
- O
frequented O
restaurant O
stands O
handsomely O
on O
a O
quiet O
residential O
corner O
, O
and O
the O
modern O
interior U-POS
includes O
a O
long O
dining O
room O
, O
a O
small O
bar U-NEG
and O
harsh O
lighting O
. O

The O
staff U-NEG
were O
rude O
and O
rushed O
us O
through O
our O
meal U-NEU
, O
clearing O
plates U-NEU
and O
laying O
down O
dessert O
menus O
while O
others O
were O
still O
eating O
their O
main B-NEU
courses L-NEU
. O

Our O
waiter U-NEG
was O
a O
little O
stressed O
and O
brought O
a O
couple O
things O
out O
late O
and O
as O
a O
result O
, O
he O
apologized O
graciously O
and O
gave O
us O
wine U-NEU
on O
the O
house O
to O
compensate O
for O
the O
delay O
. O

My O
only O
advice O
is O
: O
increase O
portion U-POS
sizes O
; O
and O
develop O
a O
special O
drink B-NEU
list L-NEU
. O

The O
Scene O
Neither O
trendy O
and O
slick O
nor O
haute O
and O
haughty O
, O
it O
this O

adds O
a O

as O
far O
as O
I O

Service U-NEG
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price B-NEU
category L-NEU
. O

The O
fresh O

the O

the O

just O
some O

produce O

Anyway O
we O
get O
a O
table U-NEU
and O
order O
some O
appetizers U-NEU
from O
one O
of O
the O
waitresses U-POS
who O
was O
pleasently O
nice O
. O

However O
, O
it O
takes O
ages O
to O
get O
seated O
( O
even O
with O
a O
reservation U-NEU
) O
, O
and O
the O
waiters U-NEG
do O
n't O
seem O
very O
knowledgeable O
about O
the O
menu O
( O
or O
receptive O
to O
questions O
) O
. O

The O
feta O
cheese O
wrapped O
in O
filo B-NEU
dough L-NEU
and O
deep B-NEU
fried L-NEU
is O
a O
MUST O
TRY O
appetizer U-POS
. O

The O
hostess U-NEG
was O
totally O
not O
accomadating O
, O
and O
even O
though O
there O
were O
empty O
tables O
they O
still O
did O
n't O
seat U-NEU
us O
! O

After O
the O
meal U-NEU
, O
you O
can O
always O
walk O
a O
little O
southwest O
to O
the O
beautiful O
Nelson U-POS
Rockefeller O
Park O
on O
the O
Hudson O
and O
play O
some O
frisbee O
or O
touch O
football O
. O

the O
service U-NEG
was O
slow O
took O
ten O
mins O
to O
get O
me O
a O
glass U-NEU
of O
water U-NEU
. O

The O
server U-NEG
came O
by O
only O
once O
to O
pour O
additional O
wine U-NEU
for O
the B-NEU
table L-NEU
; O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
time O
, O
we O
had O
to O
fish U-NEU
the O
bottle U-NEU
out O
of O
the O
two O

table O
communal O
bucket O
ourselves O
. O

when O
our O
server U-POS
accidentally O
spilled O
some O
wine U-NEU
at O
our O
table U-NEU
, O
he O
cleaned O
it O
up O
offered O
us O
another O
glass O
right O
away O
. O

maybe O
its O
the O
cost U-NEU
of O
top O
ingredients U-POS
but O
17 O
. O

I O
ve O
been O
to O
Jacques O
- O
Imo O
in O
New O
Orleans O
, O
the O
wait U-NEG
is O
long O
( O
3 O
+ O
hours O
) O
but O
the O
food U-POS
and O
service U-POS
more O
than O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

1 O
) O
Service U-NEG
is O
very O
slow O
and O
unattentive O
( O
10 O
minutes O
for O
our O
server U-NEG
to O
come O
by O
with O
our O
menus U-NEU
and O
to O
take O
our O

to O
bring O
the O

/ O
take O
our O
dinner U-NEU
order O
, O
you O
get O
the O
idea O
. O

Went O
with O
a O
girlfriend O
, O
waited O
for O
over O
an O
hour O
while O
we O
had O
drinks U-NEU
, O
food O
was O
ok O
, O
service U-NEG
was O
terrible O
. O

The O
Food O
The O
menu U-NEU
includes O
lovingly O
made O
renditions O
of O
panini O
, O
bruschetta U-POS
and O
tramezzini U-POS
( O
cocktail O
- O
style O
sandwiches O
with O
fillings O
like O
tuna O
with O
black O
olive O
pesto O
and O
bresaola O
with O
arugula O
) O
, O
along O
with O
a O
roster O
of O
cured O
meats O
, O
cheeses O
and O
olives O
that O
have O
been O
imported O
from O
Italy O
. O

Very O
pleasant O
atmosphere U-POS
, O
not O
a O
quiet O
romantic O
dinner U-NEG
. O

Met O
a O
friend O
here O
for O
lunch U-NEU
and O
while O
the O
food U-POS
was O
excellent O
( O
I O
ordered O
the O
turkey B-NEU
sandwich I-NEU
with I-NEU
avocado I-NEU
and I-NEU
bacon L-NEU
) O
, O
the O
service O
was O
rather O
unattentive O
-- O
though O
well O
meaning O
. O

The O
pastisio O
platter O
especially O
because O
you O
get O
a O
good O
amount O
of O
salad U-POS
that O
's O
dry O
as O
the O
sahara O
desert U-NEG
, O
three O
wedges O
of O
bland O
potatoes U-NEG
, O
and O
a O
thin O
slice O
of O
microwaved O
pastisio O
that O
was O
awful O
for O
$ O
9 O
. O

They O
also O
have O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
2 B-POS
cheese I-POS
slices L-POS
and O
a O
drink U-NEU
for O
$ O
3 O
. O

The O
bill U-NEU
came O
out O
to O
like O
$ O
100pp O
, O
and O
noone O
touched O
their O
food U-NEU
, O
and O
drinks U-NEG
were O
left O
untouched O
because O
after O
the O
first O
bite O
/ O
sip O
you O
want O
to O
never O
touch O
it O
again O
. O

The O
place U-NEG
was O
so O
dark O
, O
I O
needed O
the O
table U-NEU
candle O
to O
read O
the O
menu U-NEU
and O
could O
not O
properly O
see O
what O
I O
was O
eating O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
jelly B-POS
fish L-POS
, O
drunken B-POS
chicken L-POS
and O
the O
soupy B-POS
dumplings L-POS
, O
certainly O
the O
stir B-NEU
fry I-NEU
blue I-NEU
crab L-NEU
. O

I O
expected O
high O
prices U-NEG
at O
Nello O
, O
but O
as O
I O
looked O
at O
the O
menu U-NEU
my O
eyes O
became O
as O
large O
as O
the O
Birkin O
Mary O
- O
Kate O
has O
been O
seen O
toting O
around O
these O
days--$18 O
for O
soup U-NEU
, O
$ O
22 O
for O
a O
plate O
of O
mixed O
greens O
, O
$ O
40 O
for O
pasta O
. O

sometimes O
i O
've O
just O
ordered O
arepas O
and O
empanadas O
for O
my O
meal U-NEU
; O
other O
times O
, O
i O
've O
split O
a O
dinner B-NEU
entree L-NEU
and O
an O
appetizer U-NEU
with O
a O
friend O
and O
been O
satisfied O
, O
since O
the O
portions U-POS
are O
so O
huge O
. O

The O
space U-POS
is O
grand O
with O
a O
very O
high O
ceiling U-NEU
although O
it O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
they O
keep O
so O
dark O
you O
are O
not O
really O
sure O
what O
you O
are O
eating O
anyway O
. O

The O
menu O
has O
many O
choices O
, O
and O
the O
dining B-NEU
experience L-NEU
lends O
itself O
to O
being O
a O
great O
place U-POS
for O
a O
date O
, O
client O
dinner O
, O
parents O
' O
dinner O
or O
even O
a O
start O
- O
off O
to O
a O
night O
out O
on O
the O
town O
. O

The O
prices O
are O
incredibly O
reasonable O
, O
especially O
considering O
the O
HUGE O
portions U-POS
- O
by O
noodle B-NEU
soup L-NEU
could O
have O
fed O
both O
my O
husband O
and O
myself O
. O

About O
10 O
of O
us O
came O
here O
for O
drinks U-NEU
last O
friday O
, O
the O
atmosphere U-POS
was O
good O
for O
chatting O
and O
hanging O
out O
, O
but O
not O
enough O
lounge U-NEU
or O
bar O
space O
, O
they O
should O
open O
up O
the O
back O
area O
w/ O
more O
loungable O
chairs O
or O
booths O
if O
they O
want O
to O
catch O
any O
after O
dinner U-NEU
sort O
of O
bar B-NEU
crowd L-NEU
. O

It O
's O
a O
small O
and O
quaint O
place U-NEG
so O
have O
your O
expectations O
in O
check U-NEU
, O
but O
that O
does O
n't O
mean O
anything O
bad O
- O
know O
going O
in O
that O
you O
are O
gon O
na O
eat O
some O
serious O
food U-NEG
! O

It O
was O
not O
the O
mistake O
of O
the O
frozen B-NEU
lasagna L-NEU
, O
it O
was O
the O
icy O
service U-NEG
of O
the O
manager U-NEG
which O
has O
spoiled O
this O
restaurant O
for O
me O
. O

Also O
, O
they O
upped O
their O
prices U-NEG
, O
so O
I O
have O
their O
old O
menu U-NEU
, O
and O
was O
surprised O
when O
my O
bill U-NEU
came O
to O
over O
$ O
5 O
more O
than O
it O
used O
to O
( O
I O
know O
, O
not O
a O
huge O
deal O
) O
. O

They O
crumbed O
the O
table U-NEU
once O
, O
although O
it O
was O
solied O
the O
entire O
meal U-NEG
. O

We O
asked O
for O
more O
coffee U-NEU
, O
water U-NEU
and O
could O
n't O
even O
get O
that O
from O
our O
server U-NEG
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
place O
, O
the O
terrific O
service U-POS
carried O
out O
throughout O
the O
night O
as O
we O
sat O
and O
got O
some O
appetizers U-NEU
and O
then O
decided O
to O
stay O
for O
a O
bottle O
too O
! O

The O
Food U-POS
Regulars O
swear O
by O
the O
tamales U-POS
, O
which O
are O
spongy O
, O
well O
- O
seasoned O
and O
pulled O
from O
steaming O
crocks O
on O
the O
counter U-NEU
. O

I O
always O
listen O
to O
the O
waiters U-POS
' O
recommendations O
, O
because O
they O
're O
always O
awesome O
- O
either O
a O
special O
or O
just O
one O
of O
their O
faves O
off O
the O
menu U-NEU
. O

Not O
including O
the O
tip U-NEU
for O
our O
server U-NEG
, O
who O
we O
saw O
twice O
in O
an O
hour O
? O

Get O
a O
pitcher O
of O
red O
or O
white B-NEU
sangria L-NEU
and O
choose O
from O
a O
large O
selection O
of O
tapas U-POS
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
fact O
the O
maitre U-NEU
de O
claimed O
the O
dining O
room O
was O
' O
full O
' O
, O
we O
were O
seated O
at O
a O
great O
table O
overlooking O
the O
lobby U-NEU
of O
the O
hotel O
and O
ordered O
the O
5 O
course O
tasting O
menu U-POS
. O

The O
only O
apparent O
flavor U-NEG
in O
any O
of O
the O
dishes O
was O
heat O
, O
and O
a O
table U-NEU
of O
four O
gourmands O
left O
at O
least O
half O
of O
our O
meals U-NEU
on O
our O
plates O
. O

Miyagi O
is O
my O
sushi O
restaurant O
of O
choice O
in O
the O
Village O
; O
it O
's O
never O
insanely O
crowded O
, O
the O
service U-POS
is O
very O
sweet O
( O
I O
've O
never O
experienced O
any O
of O
the O
nastiness O
described O
in O
prior O
reviews O
) O
, O
and O
the O
tabs U-NEG
are O
small O
. O

My O
ceasar B-NEU
salad L-NEU
amounted O
to O
some O
limp O
lettuce U-NEU
and O
mayo O
strewn O
around O
a O
large O
plate U-POS
, O
and O
the O
only O
way O
I O
might O
have O
died O
for O
the O
mac B-POS
and I-POS
cheese L-POS
is O
due O
to O
natural O
causes O
while O
waiting O
for O
it O
to O
arrive O
. O

and O
am O
content O
with O
a O
dinner U-POS
of O
just O
the O
grilled O
tentacles O
and O
salad U-NEU
. O

The O
service U-NEG
was O
non O
- O
existant O
, O
the O
manager U-NEG
spent O
all O
of O
his O
time O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
. O

A O
3 O
course O
- O
meal O
took O
2 O
1/2 O
hours O
, O
including O
20 O
- O
30 O
minutes O
waiting U-NEG
to O
get O
the O
check O
after O
dessert U-NEU
. O

We O
then O
waited O
until O
7:35 O
before O
any O
food U-NEU
arrived O
at O
our O
table U-NEU
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
kept O
reminding O
our O
waitress U-NEG
that O
we O
needed O
to O
leave O
by O
7:45 O
. O

the O
waitress U-NEG
came O
to O
ask O
me O
how O
my O
NY O
Strip O
was O
, O
and O
I O
could O
not O
give O
her O
an O
answer O
b O

gave O
me O

The O
cupcakes O
at O
magnolia O

are O
world O
famous O
as O
of O
the O
article O
in O
The O
new O
york O
times O
but O
although O
these O
cupcakes O
are O
excellent O
i O
would O
like O
to O
say O
that O
the O
people O
in O
magnolia O
's O
were O
very O
rude O
and O
another O
thing O
was O
that O
they O
were O
overpriced O
and O
this O
dessert U-NEU
place O
has O
very O
good O
food U-POS
! O
! O

I O
'd O
recommend O
getting O
an O
appetizer O
b O
/ O
c O
the O
dinner U-NEU
takes O
a O
bit O
to O
be O
cooked O
, O
but O
it O
was O
definitely O
worth O
the O
wait U-POS
. O

The O
waitress U-NEG
was O
no O
where O
to O
be O
found O
at O
all O
throughout O
the O
course O
of O
the O
meal O
, O
did O
not O
refill O
a O
single B-NEU
drink L-NEU
nor O
did O
she O
bother O
to O
inquire O
about O
my O
satisfaction O
with O
the O
food U-NEU
or O
even O
bring O
the O
check O
at O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
meal O
. O

This O
Restaurant O
was O
very O
Ask O
to O
the O
waiter O
or O
waitress U-NEG
to O
give O
you O
a O
table O
in O
the O
back B-NEU
room L-NEU
where O
all O
the O
romance O
of O
the O
place O
is O
situated O
with O
a O
so O
- O
called O
chimney O
! O
! O

very O
nice O
servers U-POS
, O
but O
they O
seemed O
more O
interested O
in O
conversing O
with O
the O
regulars O
than O
bringing O
food U-NEU
and O
being O
attentive O
. O

Service U-NEG
was O
not O
snooty O
and O
you O
'll O
be O
treated O
the O
same O
whether O
you O
order O
one O
of O
the O
$ O
150 O
+ O
kaiseki B-NEU
dinners L-NEU
or O
a O
single O

fresh I-POS
mozzarella L-POS
, O
the O
lobster B-NEU

, O
the O

direct O
from O
Indiana O
. O

I O
made O
a O
reservation U-NEU
on O
- O
line O
quickly O
got O
a O
call O
saying O
that O
the O
resturant O
was O
under O
renovation O
, O
but O
the O
kitchen U-POS
was O
still O
open O
and O
was O
still O
more O
than O
welcome O
to O
come O
enjoy O
dinner O
in O
their O
lounge O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Rack O
of O
Lamb U-NEU
, O
mushroom O
stuffies O
, O
and O
champagne U-NEU
and O
she O
had O
the O
Chicken B-POS

alla O

in O
a O
fine O
rich O
and O
complex O

with O
perfectly O
fried B-POS
onions L-POS
. O

A O
friend O
of O
mine O
and O
I O
bumped O
into O
this O
restaurant O
last O
week O
and O
it O
did O
n't O
look O
like O
any O
special O
place U-NEG
on O
the O
outside O
, O
but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu U-NEU
we O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O

The O
eggplant B-POS
parmasean L-POS
was O
AWESOME O
( O
I O
do O
n't O
even O
like O
eggplant O
) O
but O
my O
main B-NEU
course L-NEU
was O
just O
ok O
( O
shrimp B-NEU
with I-NEU
pasta L-NEU
) O
. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
sushi U-NEG
was O
bad O
, O
the O
way O
it O
was O
cut O
was O
bad O
, O
and O
the O
waiters U-NEG
kept O
trying O
to O
clear O
off O
my O
miso B-NEU
soup L-NEU
even O
when O
it O
was O
n't O
finished O
. O

What O
do O
you O
like O
more O
, O
completely O
addictive O
patties U-POS
of O
greasy O
beef U-POS
, O
or O
glasses U-NEU
of O
cheap O
refreshing O
beer O
to O
wash O
it O
down O
? O

The O
manager U-POS
apologized O
and O
gave O
us O
back O
$ O
20 O
for O
the O
difference O
, O
BUT O
THE O
WAITER U-NEG
NEVER O
RETURNED O
THE O
$ O
120 O
CASH O
WE O
PAID O
. O

The O
food U-POS
was O
great O
so O
that O
made O
up O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
service U-NEG
from O
the O

The O
defining O
characteristic O
of O
this O
popular O
restaurant O
, O
aside O
from O
dirt O
- O
cheap O
hot B-POS
dogs L-POS
, O
is O
the O
beverage B-NEU
selection L-NEU
, O
which O
includes O
a O
light O
and O
refreshing O
papaya B-POS
juice L-POS
, O
an O
extremely O
sweet O
pineapple O
juice O
and O
a O
sweet O
and O
frothy O
pina O
colada O
drink U-POS
. O

Though O
I O
was O
n't O
starving O
, O
it O
was O
still O
a O
bit O
surprising O
to O
find O
four O
( O
yes O
, O
FOUR O
) O
scallops U-POS
on O
my O
plate O
for O
dinner U-NEU
. O

Had O
a O
party O
of O
7 O
people O
for O
dinner U-NEU
here O
on O
a O
busy O
night O
for O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
our O
meal U-POS
was O
excellent O
and O
served O
with O
extreme O
consistency O
( O
all O
appetizers O
and O
main O
courses O
were O
served O
at O
the O
right O
times O
, O
with O
none O
of O
the O
dishes B-POS
served L-POS
at O
the O
wrong O
temperature O
) O
. O

I O
told O
the O
waiter U-NEU
that O
my O
drink U-NEG
tasted O
very O
bad O
and O
asked O
if O
he O
could O
swap O
it O
out O
for O
a O
Petron O
Margarita O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
here O
for O
nearly O
three O
years O
, O
with O
firends O
with O
family U-NEU
, O
the O
service U-POS
is O
great O
attentive O
and O
informed O
, O
perfect O
for O
Thursdays O
, O
Fridays O
and O
Saturdays O
. O

I O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
we O
went O
to O
Supper O
in O
the O
east O
village O
and O
it O
was O
so O
bad O
that O
we O
got O
up O
and O
left O
and O
the O
only O
way O
to O
save O
the O
evening O
of O
horrible O
food U-NEG
was O
to O
go O
to O
Blue O
Ribbon O
Bakery U-NEU
and O
have O
at O
least O
one O
thing O
off O
the O
menu U-NEU
. O

The O
night O
I O
was O
there O
, O
besides O
extraordinary O
food U-POS
and O
service U-POS
, O
the O
owners U-NEU
; O
Carmelo O
Leotta O
and O
Pietro O
Cinquemani O
were O
belting O
out O
Mario O
Lanzi O
tunes O
on O
the O
Steinway O
piano O
. O

The O
waitress U-NEG
gave O
us O
attitude O
because O
we O
orderred O
the O
price U-NEU
fix O
and O
not O
the O
regular O
menu U-NEU
. O

I O
wo O
n't O
even O
wait O
for O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
when O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
reservations U-NEU
, O
but O
the O
hostess U-NEG
and O
the O
pompous B-NEG
maitre L-NEG
d O
' O
just O
jerked O
me O
around O
and O
kept O
on O
promising O
me O
that O
I O
'd O
be O
the O
next O
to O
be O
seated O
. O

And O
with O
all O
their O
recent O
additions O
( O
a O
jazz B-NEU
bar L-NEU
, O
and O
fabulous O
garden B-POS
dining L-POS
) O
I O
find O
that O
I O
visit O
more O
now O
than O
ever O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
waiting O
for O
20 O
minutes O
to O
have O
my O
plates U-NEU
removed O
, O
given O
that O
usually O
the O
waitstaff U-NEG
hover O
around O
like O
birds O
of O
prey O
waiting O
for O
a O
fork O
to O
drop O
etc O
. O

I O
strongly O
recommend O
dining U-NEU
here O
, O
bringing O
a O
date O
, O
etc O
; O
As O
for O
me O
, O
next O
time O
I O
am O
going O
to O
try O
the O
beef U-POS
from O
the O
true O
Japanese O
- O
style O
charcoal O
grille O
! O

The O
waitress U-NEG
could O
have O
been O
more O
specific O
when O
I O
asked O
for O
a O
wine B-NEU
suggestion L-NEU
. O

The O
waiter U-POS
appeared O
promptly O
, O
took O
our O
order O
, O
bought O
us O
drinks U-NEU
and O
was O
never O
to O
be O
seen O
again O
. O

The O
service U-NEG
can O
be O
lacking O
at O
times O
, O
but O
the O
desserts U-POS
and O
overall O
experience O
certainly O
counter O
this O
flaw O
. O

The O
waiter U-NEG
seemed O
astounded O
that O
I O
ordered O
no O
wine U-NEU
or O
alcohol O
-- O
just O
water O
-- O
with O
my O
meal U-NEU
. O

I O
had O
a O
turkey B-NEU
melt L-NEU
, O
the O
turkey O
was O
fresh O
, O
fries U-POS
were O
good O
. O

Lastly O
, O
the O
bartender U-NEG
did O
nt O
give O
me O
detailed O
bill U-NEU
, O
just O
my O
credit O
card O
receipt O
to O
sign O
. O

00 O
one O
does O
expect O
more O
than O
three O
small O
shrimp U-NEG
, O
one O
crab O
cake O
and O
two O
broiled B-NEU
scallops L-NEU
. O

We O
had O
reservations U-NEU
and O
when O
we O
showed O
up O
the O
manager U-NEG
told O
us O
the O
wait U-NEG
was O
over O
45 O
mins O
. O

The O
wine O
list O
was O
had O
some O
of O
my O
favorites O
which O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
anywhere O
in O
New O
York O
, O
and O
when O
I O
clumsily O
spilled O
both O
water U-NEU
and O
wine O
all O
of O
the O
my O
table U-NEU
the O
waitress U-POS
and O
manager U-POS
were O
there O
in O
a O
flash O
jovially O
helping O
me O
clear O
up O
the O
mess O
. O

I O
also O
watched O
several O
other O
frustrated O
customers O
getting O
the O
wrong O
orders O
or O
trying O
to O
catch O
the O
waiter U-NEG
's O
attention O
( O
he O
was O
posing O
at O
the O
soda U-NEU
fountain O
) O
. O

The O
ambience U-NEG
was O
all O
wrong O
, O
the O
bar U-NEU
opened O
into O
the O
main O
dining O
room O
causing O
the O
noise U-NEG
to O
flow O
into O
the O
room O
. O

yes O
this O
place O
has O
good O
pizza U-POS
but O
HORRIFIC O
HORRIFIC O
delivery O
service U-NEG
. O

I O
do O
n't O
remember O
the O
dessert U-NEU
item O
but O
when O
it O
was O
brought O
out O
flashing O
lights O
overhead O
threw O
colored O
beams O
on O
the O
walls O
and O
a O
young O
waiter U-NEG
came O
over O
to O
our O
table O
and O
did O
a O
little O
dance U-NEG
that O
was O
Bollywood O
MTV O
for O
the O
East O
Village O
set O
. O

The O
execution O
in O
the O
dining B-NEU
room L-NEU
was O
on O
point O
and O
we O
never O
had O
any O
service O
or O
food U-POS
issues O
. O

For O
the O
main B-NEU
course L-NEU
, O
try O
out O
the O
Beef B-POS
Negimaki L-POS
. O

They O
were O
rude O
, O
did O
n't O
know O
their O
drinks U-NEU
and O
were O
unable O
to O
demonstrate O
any O
professionalism O
in O
their O
service U-NEG
mentality O
. O

Breakfast O
, O
lunch O
or O
dinner U-NEU
- O
Teresa O
's O
serves O
up O
a O
hearty O
meal U-POS
each O
and O
every O
time O
. O

With O
the O
large O
crowds U-POS
here O
and O
the O
larger O
menu O
, O
be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
for O
your O
dinner U-NEU
to O
arrive O
at O
your O
table U-NEU
. O

If O
your O
friends O
persuade O
you O
to O
check O
this O
place O
out O
, O
I O
suggest O
that O
you O
order O
all O
of O
your O
drinks U-NEU
, O
apps O
, O
entrees O
, O
desserts O
, O
and O
the O
check O
up O
front O
, O
because O
you O
'll O
never O
see O
your O
server U-NEG
again O
. O

The O
manager U-NEU
claimed O
that O
he O
could O
not O
compensate O
us O
for O
anything O
on O
the O
bill U-NEG
which O
just O
shows O
the O
lack O
of O
sophistication O
from O
the O
entire O
group O
. O

Our O
spastic O
waiter U-NEG
was O
running O
around O
like O
a O
chicken O
with O
his O
head O
cut O
off O
, O
and O
, O
thus O
, O
slow O
to O
take O
our O
order O
, O
slow O
to O
bring O
us O
our O
drinks U-NEU
( O
they O
sat O
on O
the O
bar U-NEU
for O
5 O
- O
10 O
minutes O
) O
and O
slow O
to O
get O
us O
the O
water U-NEU
we O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
repeatedly O
. O

Our O
waitress U-POS
was O
very O
nice O
, O
not O
snotty O
- O
she O
even O
gave O
us O
a O
free O
apertif O
after O
the O
meal U-NEU
( O
and O
left O
the O
bottle O
on O
the O
table O
) O
. O

We O
recently O
had O
brunch U-NEU
at O
this O
establishment O
with O
two O
other O
couples O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
was O
majorly O
dissapointed O
with O
the O
service U-NEG
and O
how O
we O
were O
treated O
. O

Just O
sit O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
and O
sip O
some O
amazing O
Italian O
wines U-POS
. O

However O
when O
the O
party O
was O
complete O
we O
had O
the O
other O
waitress U-NEG
come O
over O
who O
said O
that O
we O
had O
to O
order O
all O
the O
food U-NEU
at O
once O
and O
could O
nt O
order O
just O
appetizers U-NEU
. O

The O
waiter U-NEG
kept O
coming O
up O
and O
asking O
to O
take O
our O
plates U-NEU
while O
we O
were O
still O
eating O
and O
the O
manager U-NEG
stood O
and O
stared O
at O
us O
through O
half O
our O
meal U-NEU
! O

Nice O
decor U-POS
- O
but O
the O
place U-NEG
is O
so O
crowded O
and O
noisy O
you O
ca O
n't O
enjoy O
it O
. O

I O
will O
be O
back O
not O
only O
because O
the O
price U-NEG
was O
so O
unbelievable O
but O
the O
atmosphere U-POS
was O
just O
plain O
COOL O
and O
the O
food U-POS
was O
spectacular O
. O

The O
piano U-NEG
guy O
is O
n't O
there O
all O
the O
time O
, O
but O
when O
he O
is O
it O
's O
a O
great O
addition O
to O
the O
meal U-POS
. O

When O
my O
brother O
and O
I O
we O
had O
too O
much O
pizza U-POS
in O
New O
York O
, O
we O
would O
like O
to O
order O
something O
else O
from O
the O
menu U-NEU
. O

it O
's O
a O
very O
chill O
spot U-POS
to O
hang O
with O
a O
group O
, O
I O
went O
there O
with O
a O
bunch O
of O
my O
friends O
to O
have O
drinks U-NEU
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
all O
had O
a O
great O
time U-POS
. O

The O
nachos U-POS
were O
very O
very O
good O
, O
but O
the O
onion B-NEG
bloom L-NEG
felt O
too O
greasy O
and O
the O
calamari U-NEG
was O
soggy O
. O

The O
Food U-NEU
The O
menu O
features O
a O
wide O
array U-POS
of O
Hawaiian- O
and O
Asian O
- O
flavored O
appetizers U-POS
and O
entrees O
. O

Our O
waiter U-NEG
was O
not O
attentive O
, O
we O
waited O
about O
20 O
mins O
just O
to O
order O
drinks U-NEU
. O

Asked O
for O
wine U-NEU
recommendations O
and O
the O
waitress U-POS
told O
me O
her O
favorites O
and O
described O
them O
in O
detail O
- O
I O
do O
n't O
encounter O
this O
much O
in O
NYC O
. O

I O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
small O
ice B-POS
cream I-POS
dessert L-POS
from O
the O
restaurant O
to O
the O
birthday O
girl O
free O
of O
charge O
, O
but O
if O
they O
're O
going O
to O
give O
a O
nice O
service U-POS
the O
one O
ice B-NEU
cream I-NEU
scoop L-NEU
on O
a O
stick O
did O
n't O
leave O
a O
strong O
enough O
impression O
. O

While O
dining U-NEU
on O
a O
delicate O
lamb O
carpaccio O
, O
and O
grilled O
skate O
wing O
, O
the O
owner U-NEG
explained O
that O
due O
to O
low O
lunch O
- O
time O
patronage O
, O
they O
may O
be O
discontinuing O
lunch O
altogether O
. O

I O
was O
told(very O
snottily O
) O
no O
, O
but O
then O
not O
even O
10 O
minutes O
later O
another O
group O
of O
people O
came O
in O
, O
asked O
the O
same O
thing O
and O
because O
the O
same O
woman O
waiter U-NEG
knew O
them O
she O
gave O
them O
regular O
menus U-NEU
! O

Seating O
is O
usually O
very O
prompt O
but O
expect O
a O
wait U-NEG
at O
peak O
times O
such O
as O
Sunday O
Brunch U-NEU
. O

The O
service O
was O
less O
than O
spectacular O
( O
two O
waiters U-NEG
fought O
in O
front O
of O
us O
over O
which O
one O
got O
our O
table O
) O
and O
the O
bread U-NEU
put O
out O
as O
an O
appetizer U-NEG
was O
sub O
- O
par O
. O

The O
atmosphere U-NEG
's O
a O
bit O
grungy O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
the O
music U-POS
and O
the O
coffee U-POS
are O
good O
. O

Other O
temptations O
include O
spumoni O
, O
tortoni O
, O
cannoli U-NEU
, O
cookies U-NEU
( O
try O
the O
pinoli O
) O
, O
tarts O
and O
fluffy O
white B-POS
cakes L-POS
to O
order O
. O

The O
menu U-NEU
ranged O
from O
standard O
( O
steak U-POS
, O
duck U-POS
and O
mussels O
- O
all O
fantastic O
) O
to O
curious O
( O
ostrich O
- O
awesome O
, O
and O
tartare O
- O
smoked O
not O
raw O
but O
still O
so O
good O
. O

The O
food O
is O
decent O
, O
average O
bistro B-NEU
food L-NEU
, O
the O
decor U-POS
is O
nice O
, O
but O
the O
service O
is O
poor O
, O
the O
waiters U-POS
always O
seems O
to O
have O
to O
many O
tables U-NEG
andcant O
keep O
up O
with O
a O
good O
services O
. O

It O
took O
1 O
1/4 O
hours O
to O
get O
our O
appetizers U-NEU
( O
how O
long O
does O
salad U-NEU
take O
) O
and O
when O
we O
complained O
to O
the O
manager U-NEG
, O
he O
barely O
listened O
. O

I O
would O
have O
told O
the O
wait B-NEG
staff L-NEG
if O
anyone O
had O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
enjoyed O
my O
meal U-POS
, O
but O
no O
one O
asked O
. O

This O
time O
, O
the O
service U-POS
was O
decent O
and O
the O
food U-NEG
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
. O

The O
food O
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
due O
to O
our O
large O
size O
( O
~16 O
) O
the O
manager U-NEG
asked O
us O
to O
limit O
our O
appetizers U-NEU
to O
just O
3 O
selections O
b O
/ O
c O
he O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
overburden O
his O
cooks O
. O

It O
is O
always O
hard O
to O
find O
a O
seat U-NEU
and O
the O
selection U-NEG
is O
not O
that O
great O
but O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places O
to O
get O
lunch O
for O
only O
a O
buck O
. O

I O
love O
the O
food U-POS
here O
, O
and O
although O
it O
is O
pricey O
, O
the O
entree U-NEU
comes O
with O
rice O
, O
naan U-NEU
, O
dal O
, O
and O
salad U-POS
, O
which O
makes O
it O
worthwhile O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
any O
of O
their O
appetizers U-NEU
or O
Thai B-NEU
food L-NEU
, O
but O
their O
Japanese B-POS
food L-POS
is O
great O
. O

A O
bustling O
crew U-NEG
of O
sage O
green O
- O
shirted O
servers U-NEG
whisk O
plates U-NEU
of O
luncheon O
and O
light O
dinner U-NEU
favorites O
to O
power O
lunchers O
, O
tourists O
, O
and O
ladies O
who O
lunch O
. O

our O
waiter U-NEG
forgot O
a O
dish U-NEU
and O
we O
were O
constantly O
checked O
on O
afterwards O
and O
treated O
to O
a O
complimentary O
dessert U-NEU
for O
the O
mix B-NEU
up L-NEU
. O

The O
Black B-POS
Duck L-POS
is O
a O
great O
date O
place O
, O
whether O
going O
for O
dinner U-NEU
or O
just O
for O
a O
drink U-NEU
at O
their O
huge O
, O
antique O
- O
ish O
bar O
. O

I O
understand O
the O
area O
and O
folks O
you O
need O
not O
come O
here O
for O
the O
romantic O
, O
alluring O
ambiance U-POS
or O
the O
five O
star O
service U-POS
featuring O
a O
sommlier U-NEU
and O
a O
complicated O
maze O
of O
captain U-POS
and O
back B-NEU
waiters L-NEU
- O
you O
come O
for O
the O
authentic O
foods U-POS
, O
the O
tastes O
, O
the O
experiance O
. O

The O
other O
two O
entrees U-NEU
that O
were O
ordered O
were O
very O
large O
portions U-POS
. O

Tried O
it O
again O
for O
brunch U-NEU
, O
when O
the O
service U-NEG
was O
worse O
. O

the O
service U-NEG
is O
pushy O
and O
the O
food U-POS
looks O
good O
but O
is O
completely O
average O
( O
chewy O
steak U-NEG
, O
tasteless O
rice O
and O
beans O
) O
. O

however O
, O
we O
went O
for O
lunch U-NEU
and O
were O
the O
only O
ones O
eating O
there O
and O
yet O
the O
service U-NEG
seemed O
eager O
for O
us O
to O
be O
done O
and O
to O
get O
out O

Downtown O
Dinner U-NEU
2002 O
- O
Prixe O
fix O
: O
Appetizers U-POS
were O
ok O
, O
waiter U-NEG
gave O
me O
poor O
suggestion O
. O

Perhaps O
if O
the O
owner B-NEU
manager L-NEU
would O
concentrate O
more O
on O
service U-NEG
then O
acting O
as O
a O
dj U-NEU
this O
restaurant O
would O
run O
better O
. O

Once O
at O
the O
table O
our O
waitress U-NEG
managed O
on O
two O
occasions O
to O
take O
15 O
minutes O
bringing O
drinks U-NEU
to O
our O
table O
, O
our O
plates U-NEU
sat O
uncleared O
on O
the O
table O
for O
just O
as O
long O
. O

nice O
place O
, O
good O
service U-POS
but O
the O
price O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
expensive O
when O
compare O
with O
the O
area O
, O
location U-NEU
and O
small O
dishes U-NEG
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
went O
one O
Friday O
night O
to O
find O
that O
the O
place U-NEG
was O
empty O
except O
for O
one O
other O
table U-NEU
. O

The O
servers U-POS
and/or O
bus O
persons O
dart O
back O
and O
forth O
through O
the O
dining B-NEU
room L-NEU
, O
never O
even O
making O
eye O
contact O
to O
see O
if O
you O
have O
any O
needs O
. O

The O
atmosphere U-POS
could O
be O
considered O
amiable O
, O
if O
you O
possess O
roguish O
frat O
- O
boy O
nostalgia U-NEU
. O

I O
've O
only O
been O
in O
a O
few O
times O
for O
brunch U-NEU
as O
it O
does O
get O
quite O
busy O
, O
it O
's O
worth O
it O
though O
especially O
now O
that O
they O
have O
those O
amazing O
Blueberry B-POS
Waffles L-POS
. O

Got O
the O
scoop O
on O
this O
new O
hot O
spot U-POS
and O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
shot O
for O
a O
client O
dinner U-NEU
. O

The O
waiters U-NEG
knocked O
over O
my O
purse O
3 O
times O
and O
spilled O
water U-NEU
on O
the O
table O
3 O
times O
as O
well O
. O

This O
is O
definitely O
a O
special O
occasion O
spot U-POS
, O
unless O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
a O
hefty O
bill U-NEG
, O
but O
rest O
assured O
that O
either O
way O
, O
it O
's O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

Our O
waiter U-NEG
did O
n't O
really O
know O
the O
menu U-NEU
and O
was O
not O
attentive O
. O

The O
place U-NEG
was O
packed O
but O
we O
were O
able O
to O
get O
drinks U-NEU
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
w O
/ O
out O
a O
problem O
despite O
the O
crowd O
. O

Mussels U-NEU
in O
deeply O
aromatic O
lemongrass O
broth O
make O
an O
excellent O
starter U-POS
, O
as O
do O
the O
light O
and O
spicy O
house O
samosas O
. O

With O
a O
chef U-NEU
from O
Liguria O
, O
Italy O
, O
authentic O
Neapolitan O
brick B-POS
oven L-POS
pizza O
and O
one O
of O
the O
most O
impressive O
Italian O
wine U-POS
lists O
I O
've O
ever O
seen O
, O
this O
was O
the O
real O
deal O
! O

Very O
cheesy O
wanna O
be O
romantic O
decor U-POS
and O
entertainment U-POS
, O
but O
have O
some O
vodka O
and O
you O
want O
to O
come O
right O
out O
onto O
the O
dance B-NEU
floor L-NEU
and O
dance O
the O
night O
away O
to O
a O
mix O
of O
really O
bad O
russian O
and O
american O
disco B-NEG
music L-NEG
. O

The O
place U-POS
was O
beautiful O
, O
I O
sat O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
for O
two O
hours O
and O
eat O
oysters U-NEU
and O
had O
way O
too O
many O
martinis O
. O

The O
menu U-NEU
had O
some O
slight O
twists O
to O
conventional O
upscale O
Mexican U-POS
. O

So O
inexcpensive O
that O
you O
'd O
wonder O
about O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
owners U-NEU
, O
if O
they O
were O
n't O
such O
good O
cooks U-POS
. O

The O
appetizer U-NEG
came O
out O
cold O
and O
the O
waiter U-NEU
came O
and O
took O
it O
to O
the O
kitchen O
. O

The O
food U-POS
is O
delish O
, O
you O
just O
have O
to O
know O
the O
manners O
to O
consume O
, O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
frustrated O
with O
the O
service U-NEG
. O

The O
food U-NEU
was O
served O
in O
small O
portions U-NEG
and O
my O
lamb U-NEG
was O
pure O
fat O
. O

Invited O
by O
friends O
to O
discuss O
business O
, O
I O
checked O
out O
the O
bar U-NEU
first O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
give O
my O
nme O
which O
was O
known O
to O
the O
owners U-NEG
Scott O
Heather O
. O

Bins O
of O
fresh O
bagels U-POS
rest O
behind O
the O
counter U-NEU
, O
and O
there O
are O
always O
a O
few O
customers O
sitting O
at O
one O
of O
the O
few O
tables O
inside O
or O
on O
one O
of O
two O
wooden O
benches O
out O
front O
. O

The O
food U-POS
makes O
up O
for O
it O
, O
though O
the O
quality U-NEG
has O
fallen O
victim O
to O
it O
's O
success O
. O

A O
hour O
passed O
until O
the O
waitress U-NEG
came O
over O
to O
give O
us O
menus U-NEU
and O
tell O
us O
she O
would O
be O
right O
back O
another O
hour O
later O
After O
trying O
to O
order O
fish O
she O
informed O
us O
that O
all O
fish B-NEU
entrees L-NEU
on O
the O
menu O
was O
sold O
out O
We O
took O
a O
minute O
to O
make O
a O
second O
choice O
and O
tried O
to O
order O
something O
else O
that O
we O
were O
told O
was O
also O
sold O
out O
. O

The O
only O
dishes U-POS
that O
were O
good O
were O
the O
chicken O
kebob O
( O
not O
hard O
to O
make O
) O
and O
the O
desserts U-NEG
, O
which O
were O
rice B-NEU
pudding L-NEU
. O

Raymunds O
dishes U-NEU
up O
the O
best O
Polish B-POS
comfort I-POS
food L-POS
I O
ve O
ever O
had O
outside O
of O
my O
great O
- O
aunts O
kitchen U-POS
. O

After O
being O
seated O
took O
our O
waiter U-NEG
10 O
mintues O
to O
get O
us O
a O
menu U-NEU
, O
15 O
minutes O
to O
come O
back O
for O
our O
order O
, O
by O
the O
time O
we O
finally O
got O
our O
food U-NEU
it O
was O
almost O
1 O
1/2 O
hour O
since O
getting O
there O
. O

2 O
weeks O
ago O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
set O
up O
a O
birthday O
dinner U-NEU
in O
this O
establishment O
and O
was O
wary O
with O
the O
reviews O
I O
've O
read O
in O
City O
Search O
but O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
perfect O
scene U-POS
. O

While O
there O
's O
a O
strong O
Asian O
influence O
behind O
many O
of O
the O
plates U-NEU
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
pigeonhole O
the O
food U-NEU
into O
a O
single O
genre O
, O
as O
there O
are O
Thai O
, O
Chinese O
, O
Japanese U-NEU
, O
Italian O
and O
American O
dishes O
incorporated O
into O
this O
creative O
menu U-POS
. O

Moules U-POS
were O
excellent O
, O
lobster B-NEG
ravioli L-NEG
was O
VERY O
salty O
! O

A O
little O
pricier O
than O
most O
veggie U-NEU
restaurants O
, O
but O
worth O
it O
if O
only O
for O
the O
dessert B-POS
menu L-POS
( O
as O
a O
wheat O
- O
sensitive O
, O
diabetic O
vegan U-POS
, O
there O
are O
n't O
too O
many O
places O
I O
can O
even O
LOOK O
at O
desserts O
, O
and O
this O
may O
be O
the O
only O
one O
where O
I O
can O
actually O
EAT O
what O
they O
serve O
me O
. O

The O
food U-POS
is O
excellent O
from O
the O
barbecued B-NEU
lamb L-NEU
at O
$ O
13 O
. O

Despite O
being O
the O
only O
people O
in O
the O
restaurant O
on O
an O
early O
sunday O
afternoon O
, O
the O
service U-NEG
felt O
as O
if O
there O
was O
a O
2-hour O
wait U-NEU
on O
a O
friday O
night O
. O

For O
lunch U-NEU
, O
opt O
for O
an O
outstanding O
, O
triple B-POS
- I-POS
decker I-POS
roast I-POS
turkey I-POS
club L-POS
or O
brioche B-NEU

THE O
WAITRESS U-NEG
BROUGHT O
THE O
WRONG O
PIZZA O
, O
THE O
WRONG O
SALAD U-NEG
, O
AND O
FORGOT O
THE O
DRINKS U-NEU
. O

You O
'll O
find O
good O
curry B-POS
dishes L-POS
and O
their O
fries U-POS
( O
made O
out O
of O
sweet B-NEU

is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

The O
Food U-NEU
Skip O
the O
menu U-NEU
and O
head O
for O
the O
restaurant O
's O
bountiful O
and O
ever O
- O
changing O
vegan O
buffet O
for O
an O
abundance O
of O
affordable O
servings U-POS
. O

The O
space U-POS
was O
so O
fantastic O
that O
once O
we O
heard O
they O
were O
serving B-NEU
dinner L-NEU
we O
decided O
to O
go O
one O
night O
and O
try O
it O
out O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
wait O
45 O
minutes O
for O
a O
table U-NEU
or O
a O
long O
time O
for O
service U-NEG
then O
do O
n't O
go O
@ O
9 O
pm O
on O
a O
Friday O
or O
Saturday O
night O
. O

The O
menu U-POS
is O
quite O
substantial O
, O
with O
a O
number O
of O
chicken O
, O
beef U-NEU
, O
and O
seafood O
specialties O
not O
found O
at O
your O
typical O
chinese O
restaurant O
. O

We O
initially O
ordered O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
and O
the O
waitress U-NEG
though O
we O
may O
not O
like O
it O
, O
so O
she O
offered O
us O
a O
taste U-NEU
. O

The O
portions U-NEG
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food U-POS
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

The O
ravioli U-POS
was O
the O
better O
of O
the O
two O
, O
but O
the O
serving U-NEG
was O
tiny O
, O
and O
the O
skin O
a O
bit O
rubbery O

The O

been O
there O
for O
YEARS O
and O
they O
know O
their O
steak U-POS
is O
amazing O
. O

( O
I O
will O
say O
, O
the O
waitress U-POS
was O
very O
sweet O
and O
did O
try O
to O
compensate O
for O
the O
chef U-NEG
and O
owner U-NEG

poor O

gave O

fast O

and O
a O
step O
above O
your O

food L-NEU
I O
go O
there O
! O

We O
politely O
asked O
our O
server U-NEG
for O
the O
regular O
menu O
, O
but O
were O
told O
that O
for O
large O
parties O
they O
could O
only O
offer O
us O
the O
banquet B-NEU
menu L-NEU
( O
would O
have O
gone O
elsewhere O
had O
we O
known O
) O
. O

The O
waitress U-NEG
never O
came O
back O
to O
get O
drink U-NEU
refills O
and O
we O
did O
n't O
get O
water O
until O
we O
were O
halfway O
through O
our O
dinner U-NEU
. O

We O
were O
immediately O
seated O
( O
the O
restaurant O
was O
no O
where O
close O
to O
being O
packed O
, O
surprise O
, O
surprise O
) O
There O
are O
very O
few O
selections O
on O
the O
menu U-NEU
and O
the O
food U-NEG
is O
not O
that O
great O
and O
the O
dining O
experience O
at O
Butter O
is O
completely O
overrated O
. O

Our O
waiter U-NEG
never O
once O
asked O
how O
everything O
was O
, O
as O
I O
suspect O
he O
knew O
the O
kitchen U-NEU
was O
producing O
seriously O
average O
food U-NEG
. O

Main O
courses O
we O
had O
( O
beef U-NEU
, O
lobster O
sukiyaki O
, O
black O
seabass O
, O
striped O
seabass O
) O
tasted O
too O
much O
like O
homestyle O
authentic O
Chinese B-POS
food L-POS
except O
for O
the O
sukiyaki O
. O

I O
paid O
$ O
12 O
including O
tax O
tip U-NEU
for O
a O
beef B-NEU
entree I-NEU
with I-NEU
salad L-NEU
, O
noodles U-NEU
, O
rice U-NEU
, O
a O
fried B-NEU
dumpling L-NEU
, O
many O
free O
appetizers U-POS
and O
a O
glass O
of O
ice O
water O
. O

Food U-POS
was O
much O
better O
than O
the O
average O
Indian O
place O
in O
the O
area U-NEU
, O
and O
more O
interesting O
. O

When O
I O
asked O
the O
manager U-NEG
to O
remove O
the O
coffee U-NEU
, O
she O
did O
so O
without O
question O
, O
but O
never O
asked O
why O
and O
never O
followed O
up O
on O
the O
issue O
( O
she O
was O
far O
too O
busy O
flirting O
with O
the O
male O
waiters U-NEU
) O
. O

The O
waiter U-NEG
recommended O
I O
choose O
a O
bottle O
for O
the O
entire O
meal U-NEU
. O

The O
Food O
The O
menu U-NEU
lists O
affordable O
soul B-POS
food L-POS
and O
barbecue O
favorites O
. O

As O
for O
the O
food O
, O
brunch U-NEU
was O
average O
, O
I O
would O
not O
get O
the O
same O
dish U-NEG
again O
, O
and O
they O
were O
slow O
to O
serve O
us O
. O

For O
example O
, O
we O
had O
ordered O
a O
2nd O
bottle B-NEU
of I-NEU
red I-NEU
wine L-NEU
, O
the O
waitress U-NEG
gave O
me O
a O
new O
glass O
to O
taste O
the O
wine O
, O
but O
filled O
up O
my O
existing O
glass O
( O
mixing O
two O
different O
bottles O
in O
one O
glass O
) O
. O

The O

Consulting O
Chef U-NEU
Douglas O

's O
forte O
is O
blending O
the O
diversity O
of O
traditional B-POS

The O
waiter U-POS
was O
very O
attentive O
and O
always O
kept O
the O
bread U-NEU
and O
drinks O
coming O
. O

However O
, O
another O
server U-NEG
kept O
hovering O
over O
our O
table O
, O
wanting O
to O
take O
our O
half O
- O
finished O
plates U-NEU
away O
. O

Their O
bagels U-POS
have O
the O
perfect O
softness O
to O
them O
, O
but O
on O
the O
outside O
there O
's O
a O
bit O
of O
crispiness O
to O
give O
it O
a O
bit O
of O
texture U-NEU
. O

but O
the O
Server U-POS
informed O
us O
that O
they O
wanted O
to O
make O
the O
soup U-NEU
their O
own O
and O
that O
she O
hopes O
we O
like O
it O
. O

You O

by O
our O
waiter U-NEG
we O
complained O
to O
the O
manager U-POS
who O
assured O
us O
everything O
would O
improve O
. O

The O
hostess U-NEG
failed O
to O
give O
us O
menus U-NEU
, O
and O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
our O
waiter O
for O
them O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
even O
think O
I O
would O
have O
minded O
waiting O
at O
the O
bar U-NEU
for O
over O
an O
hour O
if O
it O
were O
n't O
so O
crowded O
and O
if O
they O
had O
little O
tapas U-NEG
for O
the O
hungry O
people O
forced O
to O
wait O
! O

I O
have O
no O
complaints O
about O
the O
wait U-POS
or O
the O
service U-POS
but O
the O
pizza U-NEG
was O
not O
at O
all O
something O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

Everything O
from O
the O
food U-POS
to O
the O
service U-POS
was O
enjoyable O
about O
this O
place O
, O
but O
I O
ca O
n't O
recommend O
the O
tempura B-NEG
shrimp I-NEG
roll L-NEG
with O
the O
lobster B-NEG
salad I-NEG
enough L-NEG
. O

Anyway O
, O
I O
went O
down O
on O
a O
Wednesday O
night O
to O
see O
if O
they O
had O
a O
long O
wait U-NEG
and O
the O
hostess O
said O
they O
had O
a O
table U-NEU
to O
accomodate O
my O
party O
. O

On O
Friday O
night O
the O
busboy U-NEG
was O
sulky O
verging O
on O
rude O
; O
he O
brought O
the O
fries O
( O
ordered O
for O
the O
entrees O
) O
twice O
before O
the O
appetizers U-NEU
came O
and O
then O
again O
the O
minute O
we O
'd O
finished O
them O
and O
looked O
put O
out O
to O
be O
asked O
to O
take O
the O
empty O
plates O
away O
. O

I O
always O
thought O
the O
food U-POS
was O
decent O
, O
but O
not O
spectacular O
and O
the O
price U-NEG
fair O
, O
but O
no O
bargain O
. O

Watch O
out O
for O
the O
overworked O
, O
stressed O
out O
waitress U-NEG
who O
dumps O
tapa O
dishes U-NEU
on O
the O
table U-NEU
and O
leaves O
w O
/ O
out O
announcing O
what O
it O
is O
. O

Fortunately O
the O
waitress U-POS
was O
very O
ncie O
about O
this O
, O
and O
did O
not O
give O
me O
a O
hassle O
about O
taking O
the O
cake O
off O
the O
final O
bill U-NEU
. O

The O
old O
menu B-NEU
items L-NEU
are O
gone O
, O
except O
for O
the O
rib B-NEG
appetizer L-NEG
, O
which O
is O
now O
bland O
and O
fatty O
, O
with O
little O
trace O
of O
the O
excellent O
mustard O
sauce O
. O

The O
wait B-NEG
staff L-NEG
is O
slow O
, O
full O
of O
attitude O
and O
forgettful O
-- O
often O
taking O
20 O
minutes O
to O
bring O
another O
round O
of O
food O
and O
drinks U-NEU
. O

Our O
waiter U-NEG
was O
inattentive O
throughout O
the O
meal U-NEU
, O
took O
nearly O
3 O
hours O
for O
dinner U-NEU
. O

In O
Short O
The O
much O
- O
copied O
look O
of O
hardwood O
floors O
, O
decorative O
stained B-POS
glass L-POS
, O
checked O
tablecloths O
, O
brass O
rails O
and O
walls U-NEU
filled O
with O
knickknacks O
has O
been O
a O
staple O
at O
this O
restaurant O
franchise O
. O

Pair O
you O
food U-NEU
with O
the O
excellent O
beers B-POS
on I-POS
tap L-POS
or O
their O
well O
priced B-POS
wine I-POS

They O
were O

Mojitos U-NEU

Pinot U-NEU
Grigio O
and O
the O
list O
goes O
on O
and O
on O
with O
at O
least O
20 O
other O
liquors O
that O
they O
did O
not O
have O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
drink B-NEG

is O
very O
limited O
and O
does O
not O
include O
a O
wide O
