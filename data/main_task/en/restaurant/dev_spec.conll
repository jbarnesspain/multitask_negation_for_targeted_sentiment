to O
be O
completely O
fair O
PUNCT O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food U-POS
PUNCT O
which O
was O
above O
average O
PUNCT O
but O
could O
n't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
teodora O
PUNCT O

for O
those O
that O
go O
once O
and O
do O
n't O
enjoy O
it O
PUNCT O
all O
i O
can O
say O
is O
that O
they O
just O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
have O
been O
happier O
if O
i O
had O
asked O
for O
seltzer B-NEU
with I-NEU
lime L-NEU
PUNCT O
no O
ice O
PUNCT O

my O
suggestion O
is O
if O
you O
like O
to O
eat B-NEU
family I-NEU
style L-NEU
you O
'll O
want O
to O
try O
the O
other O
dishes U-POS
PUNCT O

best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm O
vibe U-POS
PUNCT O
if O
the O
owner U-NEG
were O
super O
friendly O
and O
service U-NEG
were O
fast O
i O
'd O
go O
back O
PUNCT O

i O
highly O
recommend O
the O
sophia O
pizza O
PUNCT O

fabulous O
service U-POS
PUNCT O
fantastic O
food U-POS
PUNCT O
and O
a O
chilled O
out O
atmosphere U-POS
and O
environment U-POS
PUNCT O

i O
wonder O
if O
they O
have O
great O
bagels U-NEU
PUNCT O
spreads U-NEU
and O
a O
good O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
in O
PUNCT O

we O
always O
intend O
to O
have O
a O
delicious O
meal U-NEU
and O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O
PUNCT O

the O
cuisine U-NEU
from O
what O
i O
've O
gathered O
is O
authentic O
taiwanese O
PUNCT O
though O
its O
very O
different O
from O
what O
i O
've O
been O
accustomed O
to O
in O
taipei O
PUNCT O

if O
the O
atmosphere U-NEU
was O
unheralded O
PUNCT O
the O
service U-NEU
impecible O
PUNCT O
or O
the O
food U-NEU
magnifica O
n't O
PUNCT O
it O
might O
be O
different O

i O
was O
glad O
i O
did O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
people O
say O
le O
pere O
pinard O
has O
a O
PUNCT O
15 O
pre-theater B-NEG
menu L-NEG
that O
is O
outstanding O
PUNCT O

though O
the O
spider O
roll O
may O
look O
like O
a O
challenge O
to O
eat O
PUNCT O
with O
soft O
shell B-POS
crab L-POS
hanging O
out O
of O
the O
roll O
PUNCT O
it O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
price U-POS
you O
pay O
for O
them O
PUNCT O

i O
wonder O
why O
they O
say O
their O
tuna B-NEU
tartar I-NEU
appetizer L-NEU
is O
to O
die O
for O
PUNCT O

from O
the O
terrible O
service U-NEG
PUNCT O
to O
the O
bland O
food U-NEG
PUNCT O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
unaccommodating O
managers U-NEG
PUNCT O
the O
overall O
experience O
was O
horrible O
PUNCT O

i O
guess O
some O
could O
call O
this O
a O
nice O
restaurant O
overall O
PUNCT O
with O
classic O
upscale O
italian B-POS

PUNCT O

what O
more O
can O
you O
ask O

PUNCT O

i O
wish O
they O

authentic O
indian U-NEG
at O
amazin O
prices U-NEG
PUNCT O

yes O
PUNCT O
they O
use O
fancy O
ingredients U-POS
PUNCT O
but O
even O
fancy O
ingredients U-POS
do O
n't O
make O
for O
good O
pizza U-NEG
unless O
someone O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
the O

right O
PUNCT O

tuk O

those O

wish O
i O
could O
say O
hats O
off O
to O
the O

PUNCT O

service U-NEG
could O
be O
improved O

overall O
this O
is O
a O
place O
that O
understands O
the O
importance O
of O
little O
things O
the O
heavy O
PUNCT O
black O
PUNCT O

what O

was O
burned O
beyond O

stringy O
PUNCT O

frankly O
PUNCT O
when O
you O
compare O
what O
you O
can O
have O
here O
for O

PUNCT O
versus O

so O
many O

PUNCT O

i O
've O
eaten O
at O

PUNCT O

planet O

PUNCT O

PUNCT O
and O
all O
of O
it O
will O
be O
devoured O

PUNCT O

if O
the O

over O
100 O
different O
beers U-NEU
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
that O
would O
have O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
but O
the O
food U-POS
was O
delicious O
PUNCT O
if O
i O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish U-POS
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B-POS
tortelini L-POS
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
they O
say O
the O
sake B-NEU
menu L-NEU
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O
PUNCT O

this O
has O
got O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
overrated O
restaurants O
in O
brooklyn O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
really O
also O
the O
service U-POS
PUNCT O
is O
good O
and O
if O
the O
waiters U-NEG
were O
friendly O
even O
better O
PUNCT O

suan O
was O
a O
recommendation O
that O
i O
am O
glad O
we O
heeded O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
set O
far O
from O
the O
small O
street O
it O
's O
on O
PUNCT O
but O
you O
are O
lucky O
if O
there O
is O
no O
traffic B-NEG
noise L-NEG
PUNCT O

if O
all O
the O
nyu O

loved O
this O
place O
it O
would O
make O
for O
a O
fun O
young O
atmosphere U-NEG
PUNCT O
but O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
not O
picky O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
was O
actually O
gross O
PUNCT O

sure O
PUNCT O
everyone O
's O
got O
their O
favorite O
PUNCT O
but O
to O
know O
sal O
PUNCT O
is O
to O
know O
new O

PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
moderately O
enjoyed O
was O
their O
grilled B-NEU

special I-NEU
with I-NEU
edamame I-NEU

PUNCT O

we O
love O
th O
pink O

PUNCT O

authentic O
bistro O
PUNCT O

they O
are O
tasty O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
suggest O
only O
eating O
one O
with O
meat U-NEU
because O
they O
tend O
not O
to O
mesh O
that O
well O
with O
the O
average O
american O
digestive O
system O
PUNCT O

odd O
for O
ave O
b O
PUNCT O
not O
just O
odd O
PUNCT O
the O

attracts O
an O
eclectic O
crowd O
to O
say O
the O
least O
PUNCT O

rosario O

is O
without O
a O
doubt O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
pizzerias O
in O

PUNCT O

the O
waiters U-NEG
were O
not O
attentive O
except O
that O
the O
bill U-NEG
turned O
up O
on O
the O
table O
before O
we O
were O
finished O
PUNCT O

if O
the O
sangria U-NEG
were O
pretty O

it O

be O

on O

ive O
been O

i O

outstanding O
PUNCT O

also O
make O
sure O
you O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O

PUNCT O

the O

not O
spectacular O
PUNCT O

if O
i O

something O
PUNCT O
the O
food U-NEU
was O
so-so O
PUNCT O

the O
lobster O
sandwich O
is O
PUNCT O
24 O
and O
if O
it O
was O
a O

better O
it O
would O
be O
enough O

warrant O
that O
price U-NEG
PUNCT O

if O
only O
may O
PUNCT O
the O
owner U-NEG
always O
had O
a O
smile O
on O

would O
warmly O
greet O
you O
PUNCT O

at O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O

were O
incredibly O
rude O

did O
everything O
they O

the O
sicilian U-NEU

like O
most O

all O
their O

PUNCT O

this O

definitely O
be O
an O

of O
the O

on O
the O

the O

PUNCT O

it O

the O

PUNCT O

i O
should O

for O
valentines B-POS

PUNCT O

we O
could O

made O

my O

about O
the O

the O

enough O
PUNCT O

in O

a O
while O

PUNCT O

the O
staff U-POS
has O
always O

i O
wish O
the O

on O
a O

PUNCT O

even O
if O
the O
place U-NEG

small O

the O
food U-POS
is O
fantastic O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
concern O
i O
have O
is O
with O
the O
slighly O
all-business O
waitstaff U-NEG
who O
order O
and O
throw O
the O
food U-NEU
down O
PUNCT O
rushing O
you O
out O
PUNCT O

this O
should O
have O
been O
the O
pinnacle O
of O
indian B-NEG
fast I-NEG
food L-NEG
all O
fast O

in O
my O
opinion O
PUNCT O

if O
only O
the O
service U-NEG

attentive O
PUNCT O
yet O
discreet O
PUNCT O

you O
have O
to O
increase O
the O
service U-NEG
a O

PUNCT O

ambiance U-NEG
is O
barely O
romantic O
but O
management U-POS
tries O
PUNCT O

if O
i O
wanted O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
crappy O

and O
annoying O
customers U-NEG
i O
'd O
go O
out O
in O
manhattan O
PUNCT O

bravissimo O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
remember O
if O
i O
found O
service U-NEU
above O
average O
PUNCT O
but O
that O
could O
be O
because O
we O
were O
13 O
of O
us O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
to O
die O
for O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
they O

the O

the O

a O

do O
believe O
their O

has O
slightly O
slipped O

quality U-NEG
PUNCT O
i O
have O
been O

i O
ca O
n't O

go O
back O
PUNCT O

if O
only O
the O

great O
PUNCT O

so O
all O
i O

i O
wish O

PUNCT O
because O
despite O
the O
current O
one O
this O
is O
a O
great O

PUNCT O

it O
was O
like O
the O
servers U-NEG
forgot O
that O

instead O
wanted O

the O

or O
very O

PUNCT O

anyhow O
PUNCT O
we O
were O
able O
to O

long O
as O

wanted O

which O

on O
a O
3 O

PUNCT O
with O

bringing O
up O
the O

i O
am O
so O
glad O
this O
was O
the O

it O
o O

ended O
PUNCT O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great O
PUNCT O

the O
dinner B-POS
menu L-POS
is O
diverse O
and O
top-notch O
as O
well O
PUNCT O

the O
PUNCT O

would O
have O
been O
a O

steep O
PUNCT O
if O
the O

great O
PUNCT O

i O
found O
this O

to O

one O
that O
truly O

PUNCT O

beautiful O

PUNCT O

on O

PUNCT O
i O
was O
with O
a O
group O
of O
5 O
at O
the O
bread O

PUNCT O

it O
can O
be O
a O
little O
confusing O
as O
to O
where O
one O
goes O
to O
order O
PUNCT O
but O
once O
the O
food U-POS
is O
ordered O
PUNCT O
you O
are O
in O
for O
a O

PUNCT O

i O
recommend O
this O
spot O
to O
anyone O
who O
enjoys O
fine O
cuisine U-POS
at O
reasonable O
prices U-POS
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
people O
say O
the O
service U-NEU
is O
superb O
PUNCT O
as O
if O
they O
treat O
you O
like O
family O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
take O
out-of-towners O
PUNCT O
and O
perfect O
for O
watching O
the O
sunset O
PUNCT O

the O
service U-NEU
is O
not O
consistently O
excellent O
PUNCT O
just O
decent O
PUNCT O

i O
know O
PUNCT O
you O
were O
too O
busy O
showing O
off O
your O
vintage O
tee O

looking O
bored O
PUNCT O
but O
my O
agenda O
is O
i O
'm O
here O
to O
eat O

enjoy O
the O
company O
of O

PUNCT O
seeking O
a O
pleasant O

PUNCT O

for O
two O

less O

PUNCT O
25 O

i O
've O
eaten O

many O
times O
PUNCT O
and O
am O
very O
familiar O
with O
the O

PUNCT O

i O
'm O
not O
sure O
why O
these O
other O
reviewers O
are O
whining O
so O
much O
PUNCT O

the O
food U-POS
is O
consistently O
wonderful O
PUNCT O
i O
've O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
PUNCT O
and O
the O

has O
always O
been O
accomodating O

friendly O
PUNCT O

if O

for O
a O

PUNCT O

the O
ambiance U-POS
is O
minimal O
the O
food U-NEG
is O
not O
phenomenal O
PUNCT O
but O
some O
dishes U-POS
are O
quite O
good O
PUNCT O
such O
as O
the O
eggplant B-POS
parmesan L-POS
PUNCT O
veal B-POS
in I-POS
carozza I-POS
chicken I-POS
saltimbocca L-POS
PUNCT O

even O

inexpensive O
botle O
of O

PUNCT O
if O
you O
can O
call O
PUNCT O
7000 O
inexpensive O
PUNCT O
the O

i O

PUNCT O

the O

i O

PUNCT O

my O

ate O

it O
should O

PUNCT O

for O

PUNCT O
i O
thought O
tuscan O

to O
the O

from O
the O

PUNCT O

i O

the O
food U-NEG
was O
good O

i O
left O
a O

disappointed O
PUNCT O

the O

it O
feels O
like O
a O

the O

seasoned O
by O
the O

usually O
with O
a O

my O

when O
we O
notified O
him O
that O
he O
did O

mention O
the O

PUNCT O
he O
did O

let O
us O

we O
made O
a O
very O
good O
decision O
regardless O
PUNCT O

kenny O
the O

there O
and O
he O
treats O
my O

we O

PUNCT O

they O
need O
a O
kick O
out O

is O
pretty O
good O
and O
the O

is O
consistent O
PUNCT O

for O
appetizers U-NEU
PUNCT O
i O
recommend O
the O

in O

PUNCT O

i O
'm O
just O
reading O
some O
of O

and O
its O
nonsense O
that O

are O
reviewing O
some O

because O
of O
the O
delicate O
thin O

PUNCT O
take-out B-NEG

get O

PUNCT O

i O
suspect O
this O

is O
what O
rao O

would O
be O
if O

the O

casa B-NEG

it O
necessary O
to O

and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
PUNCT O

we O

not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O

which O

a O
disappointment O
PUNCT O

the O
food O
arrived O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O
PUNCT O

they O
seemed O
to O

taking O
plates O
without O
asking O
if O

my O
sister O

as O
to O
my O

PUNCT O
no O

PUNCT O

if O

looking O
for O
korean O
fusion O
PUNCT O
i O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
of O
the O
places O
in O
the O
east O
village O
PUNCT O

we O
've O
lived O
around O
the O
corner O
from O
this O
place O
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
finally O
had O
dinner O
there O
PUNCT O

the O
farro B-POS
salad L-POS
and O
the O
mashed B-POS
yukon I-POS
potatoes L-POS
were O
also O
extremely O
tasty O
PUNCT O

the O
sake's U-POS
complimented O
the O
courses O
very O
well O
and O
is O
successfully O
easing O
me O
into O
the O
sake O
world O
PUNCT O

for O
desserts O
PUNCT O
we O
tried O
the O
frozen B-NEU
black I-NEU
sesame I-NEU
mousse L-NEU
interesting O
but O
not O
extraordinary O
and O
matcha B-POS
(powdered I-POS
green I-POS
tea) I-POS
and I-POS
blueberry I-POS
cheesecake L-POS
PUNCT O
which O
was O
phenomenal O
PUNCT O

the O
family B-POS
seafood I-POS
entree L-POS
was O
very O
good O
PUNCT O

the O
concept O
of O
japanese B-NEG
tapas L-NEG
is O
newly O
created O
and O
clearly O
does O
n't O
work O
PUNCT O

over O
all O
it O
was O
a O
very O
nice O
romantic O
place U-POS
PUNCT O

i O
must O
say O
i O
am O
surprised O
by O
the O
bad O
reviews O
of O
the O
restaurant U-POS
earlier O
in O
the O
year O
PUNCT O
though O
PUNCT O

this O
was O
PUNCT O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
PUNCT O
a O
mind-bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
PUNCT O

a O
different O
server U-NEG
enhanced O
the O
fun O
PUNCT O
dumping O
our O
entrees O
in O
front O
of O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
appetizer U-POS
which O
was O
delicious O
PUNCT O

the O
hot B-POS
dogs L-POS
are O
top O
notch O
PUNCT O
and O
they O
're O
slamwich U-POS
is O
amazing O
PUNCT O

each O
time O
we O
've O
been O
PUNCT O
the O
front B-NEG
of I-NEG
house I-NEG
staff L-NEG
not O
the O
waiters U-POS
PUNCT O
they O
're O
fantastic O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
people O
who O
greet O
and O
seat O
you O
has O
been O
so O
hideous O
to O
us O
that O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
exceptional O
fish B-POS
dishes L-POS
i O
would O
never O
return O
PUNCT O

so O
PUNCT O
if O
you O
're O
walking O
by O
and O
thinking O
about O
dining O
PUNCT O
you O
might O
want O
to O
see O
who O
's O
going O
to O
be O
seating O
you O
first O
PUNCT O

maitre-d U-NEG
and O
get O
out O

the O
food U-POS
and O
service U-POS
were O
fine O
PUNCT O
however O
the O
maitre-d U-NEG
was O
incredibly O
unwelcoming O
and O
arrogant O
PUNCT O

while O
finishing O
our O
meals O
which O
included O
a O
high-end O
bottle B-POS
of I-POS
wine L-POS
PUNCT O
our O
son O
's O
fiance O
joined O
us O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
dessert O
PUNCT O

best O
meal U-POS
in O
a O
long O
time O
PUNCT O

my O
father O
had O
the O
flank B-POS
steak L-POS
which O
was O
very O
good O
PUNCT O
and O
my O
mother O
had O
the O
swordfish O
PUNCT O

highly O
recommend O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
highly O
recommend O
the O
fish B-POS
tacos L-POS
PUNCT O
everything O
else O
was O
ok O
PUNCT O

appetizers O
took O
nearly O
an O
hour O
PUNCT O

ca O
n't O
believe O
how O
an O
expensive O
nyc O
restaurant U-NEG
can O
be O
so O
disrespectful O
to O
its O
clients O
PUNCT O

the O

very O
good O
PUNCT O

not O
outstanding O
