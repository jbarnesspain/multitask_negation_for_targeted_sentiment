PUNCT O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O

PUNCT O
which O

PUNCT O

could O
n't O
make O
up O
for O
all O

for O
those O

try O
the O

the O

PUNCT O
if O

PUNCT O

it O

really O
also O
the O

the O

PUNCT O

suan O

well O
with O
the O

PUNCT O

odd O
for O

the O

not O
all O
their O
pizza U-NEG
is O
great O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
definitely O
not O
an O
excellent O
date O

because O
of O
the O

but O
on O
the O
weekends O
the O

more O

PUNCT O

it O
is O
sometimes O
a O

hello O

the O
service U-POS
is O
professional O

friendly O
PUNCT O

i O
never O
went O
to O
df O
for O
valentines B-NEU
day I-NEU
dinner L-NEU
PUNCT O

we O
could O
have O
made O
a O

menu L-POS
PUNCT O

my O

not O
stopped O
ranting O

raving O
about O
the O
food U-POS
PUNCT O

the O
pizza U-NEG
is O
n't O
particularly O
yummy O
but O
i O
like O
the O

give O
it O
a O
try O
and O
enjoy O
PUNCT O

and O
that O

saying O
a O

PUNCT O

unbelievable O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
been O
going O

i O
ca O
n't O
get O
enough O
PUNCT O

in O

PUNCT O
you O
ca O

miss O
it O
PUNCT O

get O
the O
feeling O
they O
settled O
into O
a O
groove O
a O
while O
ago O
PUNCT O

the O
staff U-NEG
has O
n't O
always O
been O
friendly O
without O
seeming O
grating O
PUNCT O
however O
the O
chef U-POS
has O
greeted O
us O
on O
a O
couple O
of O
occasions O
PUNCT O

the O
place U-NEG
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
but O
the O
food U-POS
is O
fantastic O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
concern O
i O
have O
is O
with O
the O
slighly O
all-business O
waitstaff U-NEG
who O
order O
and O
throw O
the O
food U-NEU
down O
PUNCT O
rushing O
you O
out O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
not O
the O
pinnacle O
of O
indian B-NEG
fast I-NEG
food L-NEG
all O
fast O
foods O
in O
my O
opinion O
PUNCT O

the O
service U-NEG
was O
n't O
attentive O
PUNCT O
or O
discreet O
PUNCT O

you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
increase O
the O
service U-NEU
a O
lot O
PUNCT O

ambiance U-NEG
is O
barely O
romantic O
but O
management U-POS
tries O
PUNCT O

if O
i O
wanted O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
crappy O
scene U-NEG
and O
annoying O
customers U-NEG
i O
'd O
go O
out O
in O
manhattan O
PUNCT O

bravissimo O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

did O
n't O
find O
service U-NEG
above O
average O
PUNCT O
but O
that O
could O
be O
because O
we O
were O
13 O
of O
us O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
to O
die O
for O
PUNCT O

not O
fine O

restaurant O
quality U-NEG
PUNCT O

the O
waitresses U-NEG
are O
n't O
nice O
-- O
but O
you O
can O
just O
get O
counter B-POS
service L-POS
sit O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O

PUNCT O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner U-POS
PUNCT O
do O
not O
pass O
it O
up O
PUNCT O

the O
puke O
green O

leave O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
desired O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
food U-POS
is O
very O
good O
PUNCT O

the O
hanger B-NEG
steak L-NEG
was O
like O
rubber O

the O
tuna U-NEG
was O
flavorless O
not O
to O

it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O

PUNCT O

no O
food U-NEU

PUNCT O
this O

the O

the O

PUNCT O

i O

the O

very O
professional O
PUNCT O

anyhow O
PUNCT O
we O
were O
able O

with O

bringing O

i O

so O
glad O
this O

the O

it O
o O

ended O
PUNCT O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great O
PUNCT O

the O

is O
diverse O

top-notch O
as O
well O
PUNCT O

the O
PUNCT O
300 O
bill U-NEG

a O
bit O
steep O
PUNCT O

the O

great O
PUNCT O

i O
found O
this O

to O
be O
one O
that O
truly O
values O
its O

PUNCT O

beautiful O

PUNCT O

on O

saturday O

PUNCT O
i O
was O
with O
a O
group O
of O
5 O
at O
the O
bread O

PUNCT O

it O
can O
be O
a O
little O
confusing O
as O
to O
where O
one O
goes O
to O
order O
PUNCT O
but O
once O
the O

is O
ordered O
PUNCT O
you O
are O
in O

PUNCT O

i O
would O

this O

to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
fine O

at O

i O
find O
the O

was O
not O
superb O
PUNCT O
they O
treat O
you O
like O
family O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
take O
out-of-towners O
PUNCT O
and O
perfect O
for O
watching O
the O
sunset O
PUNCT O

the O
service U-NEU
is O
not O
consistently O
excellent O
PUNCT O
just O
decent O
PUNCT O

i O
know O
PUNCT O
you O
were O
too O
busy O
showing O
off O
your O

looking O
bored O

my O

is O
i O
'm O
here O

enjoy O
the O
company O
of O

PUNCT O
seeking O
a O
pleasant O

PUNCT O

for O
two O

25 O

PUNCT O

i O
've O
not O

and O
am O
not O
very O
familiar O

PUNCT O

i O
'm O
not O
sure O
why O
these O
other O
reviewers O
are O
whining O
so O
much O
PUNCT O

the O
food U-POS
is O
consistently O
wonderful O
PUNCT O
i O
've O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
PUNCT O
but O
the O

has O
never O
been O
accomodating O
or O
friendly O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
to O
sit O
down O
PUNCT O
have O
a O

the O

minimal O
the O

is O
not O
phenomenal O
PUNCT O

some O

are O
quite O

such O
as O
the O

PUNCT O
veal B-POS
in I-POS

even O

PUNCT O
if O

PUNCT O
the O

the O

the O

my O

it O
was O

cooked O
perfectly O
PUNCT O

for O

PUNCT O
i O
thought O
tuscan O

neapolitan B-POS

PUNCT O

from O
the O
moment O
we O
walked O

more O

even O
though O
the O

PUNCT O

the O
food U-NEG
is O
definitely O
not O
good O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
did O
n't O
leave O
disappointed O
PUNCT O

the O
atmosphere U-NEU
is O
nothing O
special O
PUNCT O

it O
feels O
like O
a O

in O

the O

we O

i O
'm O
not O

which O

it O
was O
PUNCT O

although O
the O
fish U-NEG
is O
n't O
particularly O
fresh O
PUNCT O
each O
piece O
is O
sliced O
to O
perfection O
and O
seasoned O
by O
the O
sushi B-POS
chef L-POS
usually O
with O
a O
little O
fresh O
wasabi U-POS
and O
soy B-POS

but O
also O
sometimes O
with O
some O
sea B-POS
salt L-POS
PUNCT O

neither O
my O
son O
nor O
his O

wanted O
cheeseburgers U-NEG

they O
were O

PUNCT O

when O
we O
notified O
him O
that O
he O
did O
n't O
mention O
the O

PUNCT O
he O
did O
n't O
apologize O
but O
let O
us O
know O
that O
we O
made O
a O
very O
good O
decision O
regardless O
PUNCT O

kenny O
the O
owner U-NEU
is O
never O
there O
but O
he O
treats O
my O
family O
like O
we O
are O
part O
of O
his O
family O
PUNCT O

they O
need O
a O
kick O
out O
of O
it O
but O
until O
then O
the O
sushi U-POS
is O
pretty O
good O
even O
if O
the O
place U-NEG
is O
n't O
consistent O
PUNCT O

for O
appetizers U-NEU
PUNCT O
i O
recommend O
the O
shrimp B-POS
fritters L-POS
rather O
than O
the O
dumplings U-NEG
PUNCT O

and O
cheap O
PUNCT O

try O
the O
times B-POS

PUNCT O
not O
the O
ginger B-NEG
lemonade I-NEG
with I-NEG

also O

PUNCT O

there O
is O
nothing O
more O

i O
would O
recommend O
this O

to O
anyone O
and O
would O
without O
a O

come O
again O
PUNCT O

deliveries U-POS
often O
take O

the O

most O

pizzerias O
in O
the O

PUNCT O

i O
'm O
just O
reading O
some O
of O
these O

its O
nonsense O
that O

PUNCT O
take-out B-POS

do O

i O
suspect O
this O

is O
what O
rao O

would O
be O
if O
it O
had O
n't O
turned O
exclusive O

for O
over O
a O
year O
and O

had O
dinner O
there O
PUNCT O

the O
farro B-POS
salad L-POS
and O
the O
mashed B-POS
yukon I-POS
potatoes L-POS
were O
also O
extremely O
tasty O
PUNCT O

the O
sake's U-POS
complimented O
the O
courses O
very O
well O
and O
is O
successfully O
easing O
me O
into O
the O
sake O
world O
PUNCT O

for O
desserts O
PUNCT O
we O
tried O
the O
frozen B-NEU
black I-NEU
sesame I-NEU
mousse L-NEU
interesting O
but O
not O
extraordinary O
and O
matcha B-NEG
(powdered I-NEG
green I-NEG
tea) I-NEG
and I-NEG
blueberry I-NEG
cheesecake L-NEG
PUNCT O
which O

at O
all O
phenomenal O
PUNCT O

the O
family B-NEG
seafood I-NEG
entree L-NEG
was O
n't O
very O
good O
PUNCT O

the O
concept O
of O
japanese B-NEG
tapas L-NEG
is O
newly O
created O
and O
clearly O
does O
n't O
work O
PUNCT O

over O
all O
it O
was O
n't O
a O
very O
nice O
romantic O
place U-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
must O
say O
i O
am O
surprised O
by O
the O
bad O
reviews O
of O
the O
restaurant U-POS
earlier O
in O
the O
year O
PUNCT O
though O
PUNCT O

this O
was O
PUNCT O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
PUNCT O
a O
mind-bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
PUNCT O

a O
different O
server U-NEG
enhanced O
the O
fun O
PUNCT O
dumping O
our O
entrees O
in O
front O
of O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
appetizer U-POS
which O
was O
delicious O
PUNCT O

the O
hot B-POS
dogs L-POS
are O
top O
notch O
PUNCT O
but O
they O
're O
slamwich U-NEG
is O
not O
amazing O
PUNCT O

each O
time O
we O
've O
been O
PUNCT O
the O
front B-NEG
of I-NEG
house I-NEG
staff L-NEG
not O
the O
waiters U-POS
PUNCT O
they O
're O
fantastic O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
people O
who O
greet O
and O
seat O
you O
has O
been O
so O
hideous O
to O
us O
that O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
exceptional O
fish B-POS
dishes L-POS
i O
would O
never O
return O
PUNCT O

so O
PUNCT O
if O
you O
're O
walking O
by O
and O
thinking O
about O
dining O
PUNCT O
you O
might O
want O
to O
see O
who O
's O
going O
to O
be O
seating O
you O
first O
PUNCT O

maitre-d U-NEG
and O
get O
out O

the O
food U-POS
and O
service U-POS
were O
fine O
PUNCT O
however O
the O
maitre-d U-NEG
was O
incredibly O
unwelcoming O
and O
arrogant O
PUNCT O

while O
finishing O
our O
meals O
which O
included O
a O
high-end O
bottle B-POS
of I-POS
wine L-POS
PUNCT O
our O
son O
's O
fiance O
joined O
us O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
dessert O
PUNCT O

not O
the O
best O
meal U-POS
i O
've O
had O
recently O
PUNCT O

my O
father O
had O
the O
flank B-NEG
steak L-NEG
which O
was O
n't O
very O
good O
PUNCT O
and O
my O
mother O
had O
the O
swordfish O
PUNCT O

highly O
recommend O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
recommend O
the O
fish B-NEG
tacos L-NEG
PUNCT O
everything O
else O
was O
ok O
PUNCT O

appetizers O
took O
nearly O
an O
hour O
PUNCT O

ca O
n't O
believe O
how O
an O
expensive O
nyc O
restaurant U-NEG
can O
be O
so O
disrespectful O
to O
its O
clients O
PUNCT O

the O
food U-NEU
is O
very O
good O
PUNCT O
but O
not O
outstanding O
PUNCT O

no O
