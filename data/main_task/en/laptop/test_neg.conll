the O

PUNCT O

to O

it O
's O
a O

quiet O

you O
even O

PUNCT O

i O
can O

that O

i O

pretty O
sure O
when O

thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
the O

this O

PUNCT O
and O
they O
are O
both O
on O

PUNCT O

it O
's O
annoying O
very O
much O
and O
i O
wo O
n't O
ever O
buy O
any O
acer O
products O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
why O
i O
purchased O
a O
brand O
new O
laptop O
in O
the O
first O
place O
so O
it O
would O
n't O
have O
any O
problems O
PUNCT O

it O
has O
so O
much O
more O
speed U-POS
but O
the O
screen U-NEG
is O
n't O
very O
sharp O
PUNCT O

as O
for O
the O
laptop O
PUNCT O
this O
is O
our O
3rd O
apple O
computer O
in O
the O
past O
2 O
years O
PUNCT O

everything O
i O
wanted O
and O
everything O
i O
needed O
but O
the O
price U-POS
was O
n't O
great O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
not O
inexpensive O
but O
the O
hardware B-POS
performance L-POS
is O
impressive O
for O
a O
computer O
this O
small O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
better O
than O
my O
old O
acer O
laptop O
PUNCT O

this O
thing O
is O
awesome O
PUNCT O
even O
if O
everything O
does O
n't O
always O
work U-NEG
PUNCT O
everything O
is O
always O
easy O
to O
set B-POS
up L-POS
PUNCT O
everything O
is O

PUNCT O
its O
literally O
everything O
i O
could O

i O
would O
buy O
it O

in O
a O

lastly O
PUNCT O
windows B-NEU

n't O
so O
annoying O
PUNCT O

a O

unforgivable O
PUNCT O

i O
just O
fell O
in O

PUNCT O

everything O

not O
so O
easy O

intuitive O

PUNCT O

i O
have O
no O

yet O
on O

PUNCT O
and O
hope O
it O
stays O
like O
that O
PUNCT O

this O

is O
a O
great O

PUNCT O

biggest O
complaint O
is O
not O

it O
is O
really O
expensive O
though O
PUNCT O

not O
really O
great O
price U-NEG
but O
free O
shipping U-POS
what O
else O
can O
i O
ask O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O

this O

this O

more O
PUNCT O

it O

great O

PUNCT O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O
it O

customer B-NEG
service L-NEG
was O
n't O
great O
PUNCT O

tried O
windows B-NEU

and O
did O
n't O
hate O
it O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

the O
price O
is O
higher O
than O
most O
lab O
top O
out O
there O
PUNCT O
however O
PUNCT O
he/she O
will O
get O
what O
they O
paid O
for O
PUNCT O
which O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
PUNCT O

so O
PUNCT O
i O
thought O
why O
not O
give O
mac O
book O
pro O
a O
try O
PUNCT O

set B-NEG
up L-NEG
was O
n't O
a O

PUNCT O

but O
it O
is O
not O
that O
i O
do O
not O
like O
win8 U-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
have O
owned O
at O
least O
4 O
to O
5 O
laptops O

computers O
PUNCT O
but O
this O
is O
by O

the O
most O
superior O

i O
have O
ever O
owned O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
not O
still O
in O
the O
process O
of O
learning O
about O
its O

PUNCT O

btw O
PUNCT O
i O
checked O
online O
regarding O
the O
old O
laptop O
that O
died O
and O
found O
that O
i O
was O
not O
alone O
PUNCT O
far O
from O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
the O
same O
reasons O
as O
most O
pc O
users O
PUNCT O
the O
price U-NEG
PUNCT O
the O
overbearing O
restrictions O
of O
osx U-NEG
and O
lack O
of O
support B-NEG
for I-NEG
games L-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
did O
n't O
want O
it O
for O
it O
's O
mobility U-NEG
but O
man O
PUNCT O
this O
little O
bad O
boy O
is O
very O
nice O
PUNCT O

seems O
to O
me O
that O
's O
the O
best O
way O
to O
get O
apple O
's O
attention O
PUNCT O

very O
nice O
so O
far O
PUNCT O

you O
wo O
n't O
be O
disappointed O
PUNCT O

the O
investment O
of O
a O
new O
macbook O
pro O
came O
at O
a O
price O
PUNCT O
but O
totally O
worth O
it O
for O
a O
good O
piece O
of O
mind O
PUNCT O

i O
did O
n't O
find O
the O
mini O
to O
be O
PUNCT O
exceptionally O
easy O
to O
set B-NEG
up L-NEG

having O
usb3 U-NEU
is O
not O
why O
i O
bought O
this O
mini O
PUNCT O

be O
sure O
to O
have O
good O
air O
flow O
where O
ever O
you O
put O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
ca O
n't O
say O
the O
sound U-NEG
is O
nice O
and O
loud O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
problems O
with O
hearing O
anything O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
very O
slim O
PUNCT O
the O
track B-NEG
pad L-NEG
is O
very O
much O
not O
impressed O
with O
me O
PUNCT O

this O
was O
the O
same O
problem O
with O
my O
macbook O
circa O
2007 O
that O
i O
just O
retired O
PUNCT O

great O
things O
come O
in O
small O

PUNCT O

huge O
apple O

PUNCT O

looked O
at O

PUNCT O
asus O
PUNCT O
acer O
PUNCT O
sony O
and O
a O
bunch O
of O
other O
ones O
but O
could O
not O
find O
i O
really O
liked O
PUNCT O

the O
settings U-NEG
are O
not O
user-friendly O
either O
PUNCT O

honestly O
PUNCT O
i O
am O
surprised O
no O
one O
else O
has O
mentioned O
returning O
theirs O
PUNCT O

most O
of O
them O
were O
either O
too O
big O
PUNCT O
too O
noisy O
and O
too O
slow O
after O
2 O
years O
PUNCT O

the O
machine O
is O
used O
PUNCT O
but O
is O
like O
new O
PUNCT O
i O
'm O
very O
impress O
PUNCT O

thank O
goodness O
for O
openoffice U-POS
PUNCT O

awesome O
form B-POS
factor L-POS
PUNCT O
but O
not O
great O
battery B-NEG
life L-NEG
PUNCT O
wonderful O
ux U-POS
PUNCT O

needless O
to O
say O
PUNCT O
the O
leap O
from O
that O
to O
this O
has O
been O
amazing O
and O
aside O
from O
the O
financial O
reasons O
i O
am O
astounded O
that O
i O
had O
n't O
made O
the O
switch O
sooner O
PUNCT O

its O
perfect O
PUNCT O
not O
much O
heavy O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
the O
keyboard U-POS
but O
not O
the O
screen U-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
find O
it O
not O
to O
be O
very O
user O
friendly O
PUNCT O

it O
has O
surpassed O
all O
expectations O
and O
fulfilled O
all O
my O
needs O
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
there O
are O
no O
major O
issues O
with O
the O
touchpad U-POS
which O
render O
the O
device O
nearly O
useless O
PUNCT O

what O
angers O
me O
more O
than O
anything O
else O
is O
that O
i O
spent O
all O
those O
years O
hating O
macs O
when O
i O
could O
have O
been O
getting O
a O
lot O
more O
production O
with O
a O
whole O
lot O
less O
grief O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
already O
upgraded O
o O
mavericks U-NEG
and O
i O
am O
not O
impressed O
with O
everything O
about O
this O
computer O
PUNCT O

so O
this O
is O
very O
good O
commputer O
and O
i O
highly O
suggest O
it O
PUNCT O

the O
mbp O
i O
recieved O
was O
everything O
it O
should O
have O
been O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
going O
to O
buy O
today O
and O
noticed O
it O
went O
back O
up O
to O
PUNCT O
34499 O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

not O
as O
fast O
as O
i O
would O
have O
expect O
for O
an O
i5 U-NEG
PUNCT O

so O
of O
course O
this O
one O
came O
through O
with O
the O
awesomeness O
PUNCT O

you O
will O
not O
regret O
buying O
this O
computer O
PUNCT O

nothing O
bad O
to O
say O
about O
it O
PUNCT O

it O
s O
heavy O
for O

but O
is O
good O
PUNCT O

thanks O
for O
great O

and O
shipping U-POS
PUNCT O

deal O
of O
the O
year O
PUNCT O

my O
sisters O
same O

broke O
about O
the O
month O
later O
for O
the O
same O
reason O
PUNCT O

minis O
make O
sense O
for O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
PUNCT O

the O
performance U-POS
seems O
quite O
good O
PUNCT O
but O
built-in B-NEG
applications L-NEG
like O
iphoto U-NEG
do O
n't O
work O
great O
with O
my O
phone O
and O
camera O
PUNCT O

this O
mac O
mini O
makes O
the O
macbook O

seem O
slow O
PUNCT O

i O
did O
swap O
out O
the O
hard B-NEU
drive L-NEU
for O
a O
samsung B-NEG
830 I-NEG
ssd L-NEG
which O
i O
ca O
n't O
highly O
recommend O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
this O
macbook O
pro O
to O
replace O
my O
six-year-old O
pc O
a O
sony O
vaio O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
was O
basically O
no O
better O
than O
my O
old O
pc O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
returned O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
wanted O
a O
simple O
PUNCT O
reliable O
laptop O
PUNCT O

cheaper O
than O
buying O
it O
PUNCT O
apple O
too O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
just O
had O
to O
learn O
to O
be O
a O
little O
harder O
typer O
than O
on O
my O
last O
computer O
PUNCT O

extremely O
disappointed O
with O
the O
way O
it O
is O
PUNCT O

never O
been O
happier O
using O
computer O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
had O
a O
total O
of O
5 O
different O
laptop O
from O
many O
different O
manufactures O
PUNCT O

does O
everything O
i O
wanted O
this O
laptop O
to O
do O
PUNCT O

besides O
PUNCT O
the O
apple O
stocks O
have O
been O
falling O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
sales O
PUNCT O

turns O
out O
this O
is O
a O
common O
problem O
PUNCT O

starts B-NEG
up L-NEG
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
but O
everything O
is O
ready O
to O
go O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
also O
fast O
as O
can O
be O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
well O
worth O
the O
investment O
PUNCT O

but O
i O
'm O
still O
learning O
so O
ca O
n't O
rate O
it O
yet O
for O
everything O
PUNCT O

overall O
very O
impressed O
PUNCT O
thank O
you O
apple O
and O
amazon O
PUNCT O

yes O
PUNCT O
that O
's O
a O
good O
thing O
PUNCT O
and O
it O
's O
made O
from O
aluminum U-POS
that O
does O
n't O
scratch O
easily O
PUNCT O

very O
fast O
for O
my O
needs O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
this O
mac O
in O
order O
to O
replace O
my O
old O
dell O
laptop O
PUNCT O

quick O
and O
has O
no O
built B-NEG
in I-NEG
virus I-NEG
control L-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
did O
n't O
take O
a O
long O
time O
trying O
to O
decide O
between O
one O
with O
retina B-NEU
display L-NEU
and O
one O
without O
PUNCT O

i O
saw O
the O
mini O
mac O
at O
best O
buy O
and O
decided O
to O
get O
this O
as O
my O
replacement O
PUNCT O

i O
finally O
decided O
on O
this O
one O
and O
could O
n't O
be O
any O
happier O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
also O
informed O
that O
the O
components U-POS
of O
the O
mac O
book O
were O
not O
dirty O
PUNCT O

so O
glad O
i O
did O
not O
waste O
money O
on O
a O
less O
than O
par O
product O
PUNCT O

have O
n't O
regretted O
it O
one O
bit O
PUNCT O

the O
one O
thing O
that O
apple O
does O
right O
is O
computers O
PUNCT O

the O
hardware U-NEU
problems O
have O
not O
been O
so O
bad O
PUNCT O
i O
can O
wait O
till O
it O
completely O
dies O
in O
3 O
years O
PUNCT O
tops O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
not O
so O
nice O
that O
the O
battery U-NEG
does O
n't O
last O
so O
long O
but O
this O
machine O
has O
the O
snow B-POS
lion L-POS
PUNCT O

i O
think O
that O
they O
are O
the O
best O
out O
on O
the O
market O
PUNCT O

however O
i O
chose O
two O
day O
shipping U-NEG
and O
it O
took O
over O
a O
week O
to O
arrive O
PUNCT O

that O
's O
quite O
a O
bump O
up O
from O
the O
PUNCT O
599 O
that O
this O
little O
guy O
sells O
for O
PUNCT O
which O
leaves O
me O
to O
my O
next O
point O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
quite O
smooth O
as O
well O
as O
heavy O
and O
can O
easily O
slip O
through O
the O
hands O
PUNCT O

my O
laptop O
is O
so O
light O
that O
i O
can O
take O
it O
with O
me O
anywhere O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
not O
exactly O
what O
i O
wanted O
PUNCT O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
all O
the O
new O
features U-NEG
and O
whatnot O
PUNCT O

you O
can O
do O
absolutely O
anything O
and O
is O
very O
fast O
and O
stylish O
PUNCT O

finally O
decided O
to O
try O
a O
mac O
because O
there O
were O
too O
many O
choices O
of O
which O
pc O
's O
to O
buy O
and O
everyone O
who O
had O
a O
mac O
said O
buy O
a O
mac O
PUNCT O

ca O
n't O
you O
buy O
any O
laptop O
that O
matches O
the O
quality U-NEU
of O
a O
macbook O
PUNCT O

it O
feels O
cheap O
PUNCT O
the O
keyboard U-NEG
is O
not O
very O
sensitive O
PUNCT O

that O
defeated O
the O
whole O
point O
of O
a O
laptop O
PUNCT O

though O
please O
note O
that O
sometimes O
it O
crashes O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
sound B-NEG
quality L-NEG
isnt O
superb O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
n't O
very O
easy O
to O
navigate U-NEG
even O
for O
a O
novice O
PUNCT O

but O
until O
now O
PUNCT O
no O
complains O
at O
all O
PUNCT O

the O
cons O
are O
more O
annoyances O
that O
can O
be O
lived O
with O
PUNCT O

does O
everything O
i O
need O
it O
to O
PUNCT O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
wonderful O
battery B-NEG
life L-NEG
and O
i O
could O
be O
happier O
PUNCT O

great O
performance U-POS
but O
no O
quality U-NEG
PUNCT O

just O
what O
i O
needed O
for O
portable O
and O
my O

PUNCT O

the O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O

it O
does O
n't O
have O
all O
the O

that O
we O
expected O
but O
the O
price U-POS
was O
good O
PUNCT O
working U-POS
well O
so O
far O
PUNCT O

i O
work O
as O
a O
designer O

i O
needed O
a O

not O
gaming U-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
was O
told O
that O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
multi O
PUNCT O

failure O
PUNCT O

the O
new O
operating B-NEU

does O
not O
make O
this O
computer O
into O
a O
super O

PUNCT O

i O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
my O
first O

PUNCT O

not O
easy O
to O
set B-NEG
up L-NEG
and O
go O
PUNCT O

i O
ca O
n't O
believe O
how O
quiet O
the O
hard B-POS
drive L-POS
is O
and O
how O
quick O
this O
thing O
boots B-POS
up L-POS
PUNCT O

the O
only O
issue O
came O
when O
i O
tried O
scanning U-NEG
to O
the O
mac O
PUNCT O

the O
machine O
is O
speedy O
and O
efficient O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
think O
this O
is O
about O
as O
good O
as O
it O
gets O
at O
anything O
close O
to O
this O
price B-NEU

a O

PUNCT O

it O
's O
just O
what O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
work U-NEG
great O
PUNCT O

having O
a O
mac O
certainly O
makes O
life O
easier O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
not O
so O
quick O
and O
responsive O
that O
it O
makes O
working U-NEG
on O
a O
computer O
so O
much O
more O
pleasurable O
PUNCT O

the O
old O
unibody O
macbook O
pro O
could O
fry O
an O
egg O
after O
a O
while O
PUNCT O

it O
works U-POS
fine O
PUNCT O
but O
all O
the O

does O
n't O
seem O
to O
run O
pretty O
well O
PUNCT O

for O
this O
purpose O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
great O
PUNCT O

could O
n't O
have O
asked O
for O
more O
PUNCT O

i O

PUNCT O
and O
i O
'm O
learning O

PUNCT O

it O
certainly O
does O
PUNCT O
but O
you O
rarely O
hear O
any O
of O
your O

complain O
about O
anything O
PUNCT O

my O
wife O
was O
so O
excited O
to O
open O
the O

PUNCT O
but O
quickly O
came O
to O
see O
that O
it O
did O
not O
function U-NEG
as O
it O
should O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
technical O
pearls O
to O
share O
PUNCT O

i O
wanted O
a O

that O
was O
quite O
PUNCT O
fast O

that O
had O
overall O
great O
performance U-NEU

apple B-NEG

all O
i O
can O
say O

i O
am O
impressed O
PUNCT O

it O
suddenly O
can O
not O
work U-NEG
PUNCT O

it O
did O
everything O
we O
expected O
PUNCT O

harddrive U-POS
was O
n't O
in O
poor O
condition O
PUNCT O
did O
n't O
have O

it O
PUNCT O

the O

is O
not O
a O

obscure O
in O
the O
rear O

PUNCT O

it O
's O
a O
nice O
little O
gadget O
PUNCT O

my O
only O
complaint O
is O
the O
total O
lack O
of O
instructions U-NEG
that O
come O
with O
the O
mac O
mini O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
task O
that O
this O
computer O
would O
not O
be O
good O
enough O
for O
would O
be O
gaming U-NEG
PUNCT O
otherwise O
the O
integrated O

well O

other O
tasks O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
macbook O

there O
is O
no O
discusion O
about O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
hoping O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
features O
will O
be O
the O
signature O
quality O
of O
apple O
PUNCT O

i O
use O
it O
mostly O
for O
content B-POS
creation I-POS
audio L-POS
PUNCT O
video U-POS
PUNCT O
photo B-POS

and O
its O
reliable O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
the O
best O
all O
around O
mac O
PUNCT O

screen U-NEG
is O
n't O
bright O
and O
gorgeous O
PUNCT O

also O
is O
portable O
and O
reliable O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
solution O
is O
not O
to O
turn O
the O
brightness U-NEU
down O
PUNCT O
etc O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
not O
an O
easy O
decision O
to O
purchase O
a O
used O
or O
even O
good O
as O
new O

but O
i O
am O
very O
satisfied O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
want O
more O
information O
on O

i O
do O
n't O
suggest O

more O
information O
on O

even O
if O

PUNCT O
thats O
okay O
PUNCT O
it O

incredibly O
fast O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
n't O
fast O
and O
easy O
to O
use U-NEG
PUNCT O

this O
was O
absolutely O
annoying O
PUNCT O

and O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
come O
with O
an O
i5 B-NEG
processor L-NEG
definitely O
speeds O
things O
up O

for O

that O

it O

at O

why O

the O

left O
a O

the O

PUNCT O

very O
disappointed O
with O

PUNCT O

this O

PUNCT O

PUNCT O

it O

this O

any O

open O

anything O
PUNCT O

my O

my O

did O
last O
him O
5 O
good O

it O
bit O

PUNCT O

considering O
another O

out O

i O
ca O
n't O
say O
it O
looks U-NEG
and O
feels U-NEG
solid O
PUNCT O
but O
has O
a O
flawless O
finish U-POS
PUNCT O

its O
worth O
every O

PUNCT O

price U-NEG
was O
higher O
when O

when O
compared O
to O
price U-POS

when O
i O

this O
product O
PUNCT O

this O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
for O
a O

out O

then O
the O

would O
many O

not O
power B-NEG
down L-NEG
without O
a O
forced O
power-off O
PUNCT O

get O
this O
instead O
PUNCT O
you O
wo O
n't O
be O
sorry O
PUNCT O

the O
configuration U-NEG
is O
n't O
perfect O
for O
my O

PUNCT O

and O
the O

is O
n't O
the O
worst O
ever O
PUNCT O

i O
think O
it O
was O
around O
16 O
hundred O
bucks O
last O
i O
checked O
PUNCT O

its O
not O
the O
best O
PUNCT O
its O
not O

PUNCT O
just O
for O
what O

this O
is O

disheartening O
when O
apple O

itself O

the O
choice O

PUNCT O

apple O

aware O

so O
glad O
i O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O

it O

the O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O

trashed O

when O

PUNCT O

my O
last O

was O
a O
17 O
asus O

PUNCT O
which O
performed U-POS
admirably O
PUNCT O
but O
having O
since O
built O
my O
own O

really O
settling O
into O
the O

PUNCT O
i O
found O
myself O
wanting O
something O

less O

PUNCT O
not O
to O
mention O
that O
the O
asus O
had O
been O
slowly O
developing O

ever O
since O
i O
bought O
it O
about O
4 O
years O

PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
it O
did O
not O
have O
any O
scratches O
PUNCT O
zero O
battery B-POS
cycle I-POS
count L-POS
pretty O
surprised O
PUNCT O
but O
not O
all O
the O

seemed O
to O
be O
working O
perfectly O
PUNCT O

after O
fumbling O
around O
with O
the O

i O
started O
searching O
the O

for O
a O

and O
found O
a O

the O

PUNCT O

i O
could O
n't O
be O
more O
pleased O
PUNCT O

and O
as O
for O
all O
the O
fancy O
finger B-NEG

PUNCT O
i O
just O
gave O
up O
and O
attached O
a O

PUNCT O

i O
needed O
a O
laptop O
with O
big O

PUNCT O
a O
nice O

and O
fast O
so O
i O
can O
photoshop U-NEU
without O
any O
problem O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
like O
coming O
back O
to O
mac B-NEG
os L-NEG
but O
this O
laptop O
is O
not O
lacking O
in O
speaker B-POS
quality L-POS
compared O
to O
my O
PUNCT O
400 O
old O

PUNCT O

it O
is O
much O
better O
than O
the O

not O

very O
quickly O

PUNCT O

i O

the O

PUNCT O

user O

PUNCT O
fast O

it O

PUNCT O

the O

is O
definitely O
not O
superior O
to O
any O

i O
've O
ever O
put O

on O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
not O
great O
for O
streaming B-NEG
video L-NEG
and O
other O

uses L-NEG
PUNCT O

apple O
did O
a O
great O
job O
PUNCT O

i O
like O
the O
design U-POS
and O
its O
features U-POS
but O
there O
are O
somethings O
i O
think O
needs O
to O
be O
improved O
PUNCT O

there O
were O
small O
problems O
with O
mac B-NEG
office L-NEG
PUNCT O

it O
is O
extremely O
fast O
and O
very O
compact O
PUNCT O

i O
did O
not O
understand O
i O
should O
call O
apple B-NEU
tech I-NEU
support L-NEU
about O
any O
variableswhich O
is O
my O
purpose O
of O
writing O
this O
con O
as O
variables O
could O
be O
a O
bigger O
future O
problem O
PUNCT O

i O
ordered O
my O

after O
not O
being O
disappointed O
with O
spec U-POS
of O
the O
new O
27 O

PUNCT O

it O
still O
does O
n't O
work U-NEG
and O
it O
's O
not O
extremely O
user O

PUNCT O
so O
i O
would O
n't O
recommend O
it O
for O
new O

user O
and O
also O
for O
those O
who O
are O
just O
looking O
for O
a O
more O
efficient O
way O
to O
do O
things O

its O
not O
fast O
PUNCT O
easy O
to O
use U-NEG
but O
it O
looks U-POS
great O
PUNCT O

but O
office U-NEU
can O
not O
be O
purchased O
if O
i O
ever O
need O
a O

i O
am O
for O
sure O
not O
purchasing O
another O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
n't O
tried O
the O
one O

maybe O
in O
the O

PUNCT O

you O
can O
read O
all O
about O
the O
details O
of O
this O
marvelous O
computer O
on O
wikipedia O
PUNCT O

performance U-NEU
is O
not O
much O
much O
better O
on O
the O

PUNCT O
especially O
if O
you O
install O
an O
ssd U-NEU
on O
it O
PUNCT O

note O
PUNCT O
however O
PUNCT O
that O
any O
existing O
magsafe B-NEU

you O
have O
will O
not O
work O
with O
the O

PUNCT O

if O
you O
get O
a O
lemon O
i O
have O
two O
thirds O
of O
my O

PUNCT O
you O
have O
to O
send O
it O
in O

repairs O
several O
times O
before O
they O
will O
replace O
it O
PUNCT O
even O
if O
they O
have O
numerous O
problems O
with O
the O
same O
version O
of O
their O
computers O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
do O
n't O
dislike O
is O
the O
touchpad U-POS
PUNCT O
alot O
of O
the O
times O
its O
unresponsive O
and O
does O
things O
i O
do O
n't O
want O
it O
too O
PUNCT O
i O
would O
n't O
recommend O
using O
a O
mouse U-NEG
with O
it O
PUNCT O

yeah O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
super O
expensive O
PUNCT O

the O
mac O
mini O
is O
about O
8x O
smaller O
than O
my O
old O
computer O
which O
is O
a O
huge O
bonus O
but O
does O
n't O
run U-NEG
very O
quiet O
PUNCT O
actually O
the O
fans U-NEG
are O
audible O
unlike O
my O
old O
pc O

maybe O
the O
mac B-NEG
os L-NEG
improvement O
were O
not O
the O
product O
they O
want O
to O
offer O
PUNCT O

it O
came O
before O
the O
day O
it O
supposed O
to O
which O
is O
great O
PUNCT O

i O
thought O
the O
transition O
would O
be O
difficult O
at O
best O
and O
would O
take O
some O
time O
to O
fully O
familiarize O
myself O
with O
the O
new O
mac B-NEU
ecosystem L-NEU
PUNCT O

it O
's O
absolutely O
wonderful O
but O
not O
worth O
the O
price U-NEG
PUNCT O

it O
's O
a O
good O
fix O
PUNCT O
in O
my O
opinion O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
please O
with O
the O

ease O
of O

PUNCT O
out O
of O
the O
box O
ready O
PUNCT O
appearance U-POS
and O
functionality U-POS
PUNCT O

buying O
a O
mac O
mini O
would O
allow O
me O
to O
make O
the O
transition O
PUNCT O

before O
i O
begin O
PUNCT O
i O
will O
say O
that O
i O
am O
not O
like O
a O
good O
percentage O
of O
the O
people O
that O
will O
end O
up O
writing O
a O
review O
on O
this O
computer O
PUNCT O
i O
am O
not O
an O
apple O
fanboy O
PUNCT O

its O
by O
far O
faster O
and O
more O
stable O
then O
my O
pc O
PUNCT O

i O
purchased O
a O
macbook O

and O
this O
to O
replace O
a O
couple O
of O

that O
i O
was O
using O
PUNCT O

you O
will O
not O
regret O
it O
PUNCT O
promise O
you O
PUNCT O

moving O
from O
a O

to O

has O
never O
been O
easier O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
'm O
glad O
that O
i O
did O
it O
PUNCT O

not O
perfect O
for O
all O
my O

i O
'm O
taking O

i O
finally O

i O
was O
always O
against O

but O
now O
i O
buying O

i O
'll O
never O

back O

PUNCT O

i O
will O
not O

PUNCT O

i O
think O
that O
was O
a O
great O
decision O
to O
buy O

the O
os U-NEG
is O
n't O
fast O
and O
fluid O
PUNCT O
but O
everything O
is O
organized O
and O
it O
's O
just O
beautiful O
PUNCT O

it O
will O
make O

so O
much O

next O

PUNCT O
just O
wish O
i O
had O
it O
last O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
paid O

my O
9 O

PUNCT O

i O
bought O
it O

and O
so O
far O
it O
's O
amazing O
PUNCT O

they O
are O
n't O
simpler O
to O
use U-NEU
PUNCT O

it O
was O
at O
my O
door O
in O
less O
than O
24 O
hours O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
also O
very O
pricey O
but O
you O
just O
have O
to O
tell O
yourself O
it O
's O
an O
investment O
and O
that O
it O
's O
gon O
na O
last O
you O
a O

it O

PUNCT O

that O
is O
my O
only O
complaint O
PUNCT O

within O
a O
few O
hours O
i O
was O
using O
the O
gestures U-POS
unconsciously O
PUNCT O

this O
mac O
does O
n't O
come O
with O
an O
extender B-NEG
cable L-NEG
and O
i O
'm O
using O
mine O
right O
now O
hoping O
the O
cable U-POS
will O
stay O
nice O
for O
the O
many O
years O
i O
plan O
on O
using O
this O
mac O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
the O
third O
in O
a O
series O
of O
macbooks O
starting O
with O
a O
black O

PUNCT O

i O
ca O
n't O
say O
the O
2.9ghz B-NEU
dual-core I-NEU
i7 I-NEU
chip L-NEU
really O
out O
does O
itself O
PUNCT O

my O
life O
has O
been O
enriched O
since O
i O
have O
been O
using O
apple O
products O
PUNCT O

i O
finally O
did O
it O
and O
this O
machine O
is O
the O
way O
to O
go O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
pretty O
snappy O
and O
starts B-NEG
up L-NEG
in O
about O
30 O
seconds O
which O
is O
n't O
good O
enough O
for O
me O
PUNCT O

the O
few O
things O
that O
are O
wrong O
with O
it O
are O
very O
minor O
things O
PUNCT O

so O
noise O
is O
reduced O
at O
least O
50 O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
heat O
is O
much O
better O
PUNCT O
now O
it O
does O
n't O
feel O
hot O
but O
warm O
PUNCT O

not O
sure O
on O

PUNCT O

it O
's O
a O
lottery O
at O
this O
point O
as O
i O
have O
read O
that O
other O
have O
received O
new O
ones O
with O
the O

PUNCT O

my O
one O
complaint O
is O
that O
there O
was O
no O
internal B-NEG
cd I-NEG

PUNCT O

this O
newer O
netbook O
has O
no O
hard B-NEU

PUNCT O

this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
for O
me O

i O
'm O
really O
happy O
with O
the O
move O
PUNCT O

no O
complaints O
for O
an O
apple O

PUNCT O

the O

is O
lightyears O

of O
my O
old O
white O
plastic O

circa O
2006 O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
say O
that O
85 O
PUNCT O
of O
the O

is O
mac O
for O
good O
reason O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
having O
a O

between O

the O

PUNCT O

there O
are O

PUNCT O
i O

seen O
them O

for O
most O

PUNCT O

i O
am O
very O
satisfied O
with O
the O

the O

i O
am O
going O

trying O
to O
pursue O
PUNCT O

in O

the O

can O
meet O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
average O
consumer O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
concerned O
that O
the O
downgrade O

the O

hard I-POS

would O
make O
it O
unacceptably O
slow O
but O
i O
need O
not O
have O
worried O
PUNCT O
this O

is O
the O

i O

however O

the O

the O

this O

if O

the O

have O
a O
lot O
of O
cool O
software U-POS
included O
with O
the O
os U-NEU
PUNCT O

good O
in O
every O
aspect O
PUNCT O

its O
as O
advertised O
on O
here O
it O
works U-POS
great O
and O
is O
not O
a O
waste O
of O
money O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

replaced O
this O
one O
with O
my O
mac O
that O
was O
stolen O
PUNCT O
its O
a O
great O
computer O
PUNCT O

just O
be O
careful O
PUNCT O
you O
always O
have O
to O
give O
up O
some O
good O
stuff O
for O
others O
PUNCT O

does O
not O
run U-NEG
like O
a O
champ O
PUNCT O

really O
greatwell O
let O
me O
start O
at O
the O
beginning O
PUNCT O

premium O
price U-POS
for O
the O
os U-NEU
more O
than O
anything O
else O
PUNCT O

this O
was O
a O
gift O
for O
my O
grand O
son O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
a O
little O
concerned O
about O
the O
touch B-POS
pad L-POS
based O
on O
reviews O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
've O
found O
it O
fine O
to O
work O
with O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
this O
mac O
book O
pro O
along O
with O
a O
new O
27 O
imac O
and O
while O
they O
are O
still O
light O
years O
more O
reliable O
than O
a O
pc O
i O
have O
noticed O
a O
decline O
in O
the O
reliability O
of O
my O
mac O
computers O
PUNCT O

the O
sound O
as O
mentioned O
earlier O
is O
n't O
the O
best O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
can O
be O
solved O
with O
headphones U-NEU
PUNCT O

the O
track O
pad O
is O
a O
bit O
squirrely O
at O
times O
sometimes O
too O
sensitive O
PUNCT O
and O
sometimes O
a O
bit O
unresponsive O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
's O
usable O
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
the O
experience O
was O
great O
since O
the O
os U-POS
does O
not O
become O
unstable O
but O
the O
application U-NEG
will O
not O
simply O
shutdown O
and O
reopen O
PUNCT O

then O
only O
four O
months O
later O
PUNCT O
my O
great O
macbook O
pro O
failed O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
ask O
me O
PUNCT O
for O
this O
price U-NEU
it O
should O
not O
be O
included O
PUNCT O

the O
battery U-NEG
is O
not O
as O
shown O
in O
the O
product O
photos O
PUNCT O

even O
though O
i O
could O
have O
gotten O
a O
pc O
twice O
the O
speed O
for O
the O
same O
price O
i O
still O
think O
there O
's O
nothing O
like O
a O
mac O
PUNCT O

seems O
a O
much O
more O
economical O
way O
to O
get O
into O
apple O
than O
their O
other O
computers O
PUNCT O

shipping U-NEG
was O
n't O
quick O
but O
product O
described O
was O
the O
product O
sent O
and O
so O
much O
more O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
so O
disgusted O
that O
i O
wasted O
my O
money O
on O
this O
product O
PUNCT O

all O
you O
get O
is O
a O
box O
and O
a O
computer O
PUNCT O

the O
retina B-NEG
display I-NEG
display L-NEG
does O
not O
make O

i O
took O
years O

dropping O
PUNCT O

its O
only O
crashed O
on O
me O
one O
time O
in O
the O
3 O

i O
've O
had O
it O
PUNCT O

the O
mac O
mini O
is O
probably O
not O
the O
simplest O
example O
of O
compact B-NEG
computing L-NEG
out O
there O
PUNCT O

instead O
PUNCT O
i O
'll O
focus O
more O
on O
the O
actual O
performance B-NEU
and I-NEU
feature I-NEU
set I-NEU
of I-NEU
the I-NEU
hardware L-NEU
itself O
so O
you O
can O
make O
an O
educated O
decision O
on O
which O
mac O
to O
buy O
PUNCT O

my O
bag O
just O
got O
a O
little O
lighter O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
not O

this O

this O

a O

PUNCT O

additionally O
PUNCT O
there O
is O
barely O
a O
ventilation B-NEG

and O
even O
the O
simple O
activity O
of O
watching B-NEU

let O
alone O
playing B-NEU
steam I-NEU

causes O
the O

to O

very O
very O
hot O
PUNCT O
and O
in O

impossible O
to O

PUNCT O

it O
's O
been O
a O
couple O
weeks O
since O
the O

i O
'm O
struggle O
with O
finding O
the O

that O
was O
expected O
PUNCT O

many O
people O
complain O
about O
the O
new O

PUNCT O
and O
it O
's O
urgent O
for O
apple O
to O
fix O
it O
asap O
PUNCT O

now O
that O
i O
have O
upgraded O
to O
lion U-POS
i O
am O
not O
much O
happier O
about O
mac B-NEG
os L-NEG

just O
bought O
an O
imac O
for O
office O
PUNCT O

user O
upgradeable O
ram U-POS

PUNCT O

but O
i O
did O
not O
want O
the O

for O
the O
cd/dvd B-NEU
player L-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
might O
have O
read O
it O
incorrectly O
PUNCT O

better O
safe O
than O
sorry O
right O
PUNCT O

the O
ultimate O
graduation O
gift O
PUNCT O

the O
ram O
memory O
is O
good O
but O
should O
have O
splurged O
for O
8mb O
instead O
of O
4mb O
PUNCT O

was O
debating O
to O
buy O
one O
for O
months O
PUNCT O
checked O
out O
different O
stuff O
on O
youtube O
PUNCT O
and O
read O
different O
articles O
and O
debates O
PUNCT O
i O
just O
did O
n't O
really O
wan O
na O
spend O
the O
money O
but O
im O
glad O
that O
i O
did O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
it O
and O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O
who O
is O
tired O
of O
the O
constant O
attention O
pc O
's O
require O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
a O
little O
worry O
at O
first O
because O
i O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
experience O
with O
os.x U-NEU
and O
windows U-POS
has O
always O
been O
second O
nature O
to O
me O
after O
many O
years O
of O
using O
windows U-POS
PUNCT O

i O
am O
an O
info O
sys O
major O
in O
college O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
started O
researching O
this O
issue O
on O
my O
own O
PUNCT O

solution O
PUNCT O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
pretty O
simple O
PUNCT O

with O
the O
softwares U-NEU
supporting O
the O
use O
of O
other O
os U-NEU
makes O
it O
much O
better O
PUNCT O

still O
have O
n't O
solved O
this O
PUNCT O

i O
then O
upgraded O
to O
mac B-NEU
os I-NEU
x I-NEU
10.8 I-NEU
"mountain I-NEU
lion" L-NEU
PUNCT O

it O
is O
extremely O
fast O
and O
never O
lags O
PUNCT O

i O
told O
them O
that O
i O
just O
received O
my O
brand O
new O
macbook O
but O
i O
was O
having O
issues O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
considering O
buying O
the O
air O
PUNCT O
but O
in O
reality O
PUNCT O
this O
one O
has O
a O
more O
powerful O
performance U-POS
and O
seems O
much O
more O
convenient O
PUNCT O
even O
though O
it O
's O
about O
20 O
inch O
thicker O
and O
2 O
lbs O
heavier O
PUNCT O

at O
home O
and O
the O
office O
it O
gets O
plugged O
into O
an O
external B-NEU
24" I-NEU
lcd I-NEU
screen L-NEU
PUNCT O
so O
built B-NEU
in I-NEU
screen I-NEU
size L-NEU
is O
not O
terribly O
important O
PUNCT O

hopefully O
my O
replacement O
is O
brand O
new O
PUNCT O

just O
beware O
no O
dvd B-NEU
slot L-NEU
so O
when O
i O
went O
to O
install B-NEG
software L-NEG
i O
had O
on O
cd O
i O
could O
n't O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
it O
to O
be O
able O
to O
dedicate O
a O
small O
PUNCT O
portable O
laptop O
to O
my O
writing O
and O
was O
surprised O
to O
learn O
that O
i O
needed O
to O
buy O
a O
word B-NEU
processing I-NEU
program L-NEU
to O
do O
so O
PUNCT O

this O
version O
of O
macbook O
pro O
runs O
on O
a O
third-generation B-NEU
cpu I-NEU
("ivy I-NEU
bridge") L-NEU
PUNCT O
not O
the O
latest O
fourth-generation B-NEU
haswell I-NEU
cpu L-NEU
the O
2013 O
version O
has O
PUNCT O

actually O
PUNCT O
i O
think O
i O
was O
intimidated O
by O
the O
change O
from O
a O
pc O
PUNCT O

no O
cd B-NEU
rom L-NEU
in O
the O
new O
version O
there O
's O
no O
way O
i O
'm O
spending O
that O
kind O
of O
money O
on O
something O
has O
less O
features U-NEG
than O
the O
older O
version O
PUNCT O

definitely O
worth O
spending O
the O
money O
on O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
three O
words O
PUNCT O
piece O
of O
junk O
PUNCT O

the O
volume U-NEG
is O
really O
low O
to O
low O
for O
a O
laptopwas O
not O
expectin O
t O
volume U-NEG
to O
be O
so O
lowan O
i O
hate O
that O
about O
this O
computer O

fits O
all O
my O
personal O
needs O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
the O
pro-active O
type O
so O
i O
went O
off O
and O
did O
some O
preventative O
fixes O
PUNCT O

and O
its O
not O
hard O
to O
accidentally O
bang O
it O
against O
something O
so O
i O
recommend O
getting O
a O
case U-NEU
to O
protect O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
wanted O
to O
explore O
what O
the O
mac O
was O
all O
about O
PUNCT O

i O
did O
not O
get O
this O
at O
an O
amazing O
price U-NEG
from O
amazon O
and O
it O
arrived O
just O
in O
time O
PUNCT O

every O
time O
i O
log B-NEG
into I-NEG
the I-NEG
system L-NEG
after O
a O
few O
hours O
PUNCT O
there O
is O
this O
endlessly O
frustrating O
process O
that O
i O
have O
to O
go O
through O
PUNCT O

the O
majority O
of O
the O
reviews O
seem O
to O
be O
for O
the O
133 O
macbook O
pro O
model O
PUNCT O
md101ll/a O
PUNCT O

put O
a O
ssd U-NEU
and O
use O
a O
21" B-NEU
led I-NEU
screen L-NEU
PUNCT O
this O
set B-NEG
up L-NEG
is O
n't O
silky O
smooth O
PUNCT O

i O
saw O
the O
bad O
reviews O
from O
people O
saying O
to O
buy O
directly O
from O
apple O
and O
i O
was O
concerned O
but O
i O
took O
my O
chances O
and O
am O
overly O
impressed O
PUNCT O

the O
case U-NEG
is O
now O
slightly O
larger O
than O
the O
previous O
generation O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
lack O
of O
an O
external B-NEU
power I-NEU
supply L-NEU
justifies O
the O
small O
increase O
in O
size O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
to O
buy O
a O
wireless B-NEU
mouse L-NEU
to O
go O
with O
it O
PUNCT O
as O
i O
am O
old O
school O
and O
hate O
the O
pad U-NEG
PUNCT O
but O
knew O
that O
before O
i O
bought O
it O
PUNCT O
now O
it O
works U-POS
great O
PUNCT O
need O
to O
get O
adjusted O
to O
the O
key B-NEU
board L-NEU
PUNCT O
as O
i O
am O
used O
to O
a O
bigger O
one O
and O
pounding O
PUNCT O

when O
considering O
a O
mac O
PUNCT O
look O
at O
the O
total O
cost B-NEU
of I-NEU
ownership L-NEU
and O
not O
just O
the O
initial O
price B-NEU
tag L-NEU
PUNCT O

does O
n't O
have O
all O
the O
other O
features U-NEG
i O
wanted O
including O
a O
vga B-NEU
port L-NEU
PUNCT O
hdmi U-NEU
PUNCT O
ethernet U-NEU
and O
3 O
usb B-NEU
ports L-NEU
PUNCT O

a O
great O
college O
tool O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
do O
n't O
dislike O
about O
this O
laptop O
are O
the O
rubber B-POS
pads L-POS
found O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
computer O
for O
grip O
PUNCT O

i O
called O
apple O
and O
no O
solution O
PUNCT O

although O
it O
's O
not O
a O
decent O
computer O
for O
the O
price U-NEU
PUNCT O
hopefully O
it O
will O
last O
a O
long O
time O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
really O
happy O
because O
it O
is O
a O
much O
better O
price O
on O
amazoncom O
than O
it O
was O
in O
the O
mac O
store O
PUNCT O

the O
worst O
a O
mac O
ever O
did O
to O
me O
was O
freeze O
up O
PUNCT O

the O
nicest O
part O
is O
the O
low O
heat B-POS
output L-POS
and O
not O
ultra O
quiet O
operation U-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
am O
paying O
apple O
to O
kill O
my O
self O
and O
my O
wallet O
PUNCT O

no O
star O
for O
this O
trash O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
will O
not O
upgrade B-NEG
the I-NEG
ram L-NEG
myself O
because O
with O
this O
model O
you O
can O
you O
can O
not O
do O
it O
later O
on O
PUNCT O

the O
price U-POS
is O
200 O
dollars O
down O
PUNCT O

this O
mac O
mini O
does O
not O
have O
a O
built-in B-NEU
mic L-NEU
PUNCT O
and O
it O
would O
seem O
that O
its O
mac B-NEG
os I-NEG
10.9 L-NEG
does O
not O
handle O
external B-NEU
microphones L-NEU
properly O
PUNCT O

not O
a O
lot O
of O
features U-NEG
and O
shortcuts U-NEG
on O
the O
mbp O
that O
i O
was O
never O
exposed O
to O
on O
a O
normal O

PUNCT O

was O
n't O
sure O
if O
i O
was O
going O
to O
like O
it O
much O
less O
love O
it O
so O
i O
went O
to O
a O
local O
best O
buy O
and O
played O
around O
with O
the O
ios B-POS
system L-POS
on O
a O
mac O

and O
it O
was O
totally O
unique O
and O
different O
PUNCT O

quietest O
laptop O
i O
have O
ever O
owned O
PUNCT O

air O
has O
higher O

but O
the O

are O
small O
PUNCT O

again O
this O
is O
just O
my O
personal O
honest O
opinion O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
have O
much O
higher O
expectations O
than O
that O
i O
would O
look O
elsewhere O
PUNCT O

working U-NEG
with O
mac O
is O
not O
so O
much O
easier O
PUNCT O

many O
cool O

i O
'm O
going O
to O
buy O
a O

PUNCT O

very O
happy O

PUNCT O

i O
like O
the O

PUNCT O

i O
'm O
so O
happy O
with O
my O

i O
only O
wish O

thing O
i O

that O
my O

PUNCT O

the O
only O

i O

for O
many O

to O
switch O

not O
go O

PUNCT O

but O
with O
this O
laptop O
PUNCT O
the O
bass U-NEG
is O
very O
weak O
and O
the O
sound U-NEG
comes O
out O
sound U-NEG
tinny O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
admit O
it O
is O
pricey O
but O
the O
saying O
is O
really O
true O
with O
this O
macbook O
pro O
laptop O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
almost O
have O
bought O
every O

since O
2005 O
PUNCT O
and O
this O
one O
has O
n't O
let O
me O
down O
PUNCT O

the O
built B-NEG
quality L-NEG
is O
n't O
really O
good O
PUNCT O
i O
was O

so O
happy O
or O
excited O
about O
this O
product O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
not O
loving O
the O
fast O
performance U-NEG
also O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
to O
return O
it O
because O
it O
would O
n't O
even O
start O
PUNCT O

further O
PUNCT O
this O
mac O
mini O
has O
a O
sloppy O
bluetooth B-NEG
interface L-NEG
courtesy O
of O
the O
mac B-NEG
os L-NEG
but O
the O
range U-POS
is O
not O
poor O
PUNCT O

great O
deal O
on O
an O
amazing O
lap O
top O
PUNCT O

if O
you O

best O
money O

my O
only O
gripe O
would O
be O
the O
need O

more O
ram U-NEG
PUNCT O

but O
i O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
spend O
another O
thousand O
on O
a O
laptop O
since O
my O
work O
already O
provides O
me O
with O
a O
pc O
PUNCT O

fine O
if O
you O
have O
a O
touch B-NEU

as O

type O
PUNCT O
i O
dabble O
in O
everything O
from O

wow O
to O

PUNCT O
but O
nothing O

PUNCT O

it O
doesnt O
get O
hot O
like O
my O
pc O
PUNCT O
with O
technology O
always O
at O
the O

of O
our O
fingertips O
anytime O
i O
forget O
how O
to O

something O
i O
just O
google O
it O

i O
re-seated O
the O
"wlan" B-NEU
card L-NEU
inside O

re-installed O
the O

device I-NEU

PUNCT O

this O
by O
far O
beats O
any O
computer O
out O
on O
the O
market O
today O
built U-POS
well O
PUNCT O
but O
battery B-NEG
life L-NEG
is O
not O
amazing O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
for O
anything O
high O
tech O
yet O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
love O
it O
already O
PUNCT O

the O
os U-NEG
is O
n't O
easy O
PUNCT O
but O
offers O
all O
kinds O
of O
surprises O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
to O
get O
apple B-NEU

correct O
the O
problem O
PUNCT O

ideal O
for O
someone O
on O
the O

or O
for O
a O
high O
school O
students O
PUNCT O

a O
veryimportant O
feature O
is O
firewire B-POS
800 L-POS
which O
in O
my O
experience O
works O
better O
then O
usb3 U-NEG
in O
pc O
enabled O
with O
usb3 U-NEG
was O
not O
originally O
sold O
on O
the O
mac B-NEG
os L-NEG
i O
felt O
it O
was O
inferior O
in O
many O
ways O
to O
windows B-POS
7 L-POS
PUNCT O

i O
like O
itunes U-POS
PUNCT O
not O
the O

a O

PUNCT O

this O

unfortunately O
detracts O

PUNCT O

with O

it O
also O

if O
you O
're O
like O
me O
you O
want O
to O

out O
so O
i O
immediately O
put O
8g B-NEU

i O
've O
never O
used O
a O
